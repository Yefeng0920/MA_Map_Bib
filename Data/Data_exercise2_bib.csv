Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the effects of LAN on daily activity and photoperiodic responses in the Palearctic Indian migratory songbird, redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps), is dependent on the different phases of the night. Male buntings maintained under short photoperiod (8L:16D; L = 100 lux, D < 0.1 lux) in individual activity cages were exposed to LAN (2 lux) for 6 weeks either in 4 h bin given at the different phases of 16 h night (early, mid, or late at ZT 08–12, ZT 14–18, or ZT 20–24, respectively; n = 9 each group) or throughout 16 h night (all night light, n = 6, ZT 08–24, the time of lights ON was considered as Zeitgeber time 0, ZT 0). A group (n = 6) with no LAN served as control. The results showed that LAN at the different phases of night induced differential effects as shown by an intense activity during the night, altered melatonin and temperature rhythms, and showed an increase in body mass and body fattening, food intake, and gonadal size. Midnight light exposure has a greater impact on migration and reproduction linked phenotypes, which is similar to the ones that received light throughout the night. The highlights of this study are that (i) LAN impacts day-night activity behavior, (ii) its continuity with the day alters the perception of day length, (iii) birds showed differential sensitivity to LAN in a phase-dependent manner, (iv) the direction of placing LAN affects the daily responses, e.g., LAN in the early night was “accepted” as extended dusk but the late night was considered as early dawn, and (v) midnight LAN was most effective and induced similar responses as continuous LAN. Overall, LAN induces long day responses in short days and shows differential sensitivity of the different phases of the night toward the light. This information may be valuable in adopting a part-night lighting approach to help reduce the physiological burden, such as early migration and reproduction, of artificial lighting on the nocturnal migrants. © Copyright © 2021 Kumar, Malik, Bhardwaj and Rani.","bunting; light at night; melatonin; migratory; photoperiodic response","","","","","","Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India, (BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012); University of Lucknow","Financial support from the Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India (BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012) and also from the PROTSAHAN scheme of the University of Lucknow, is gratefully acknowledged.

Ironically, the introduction of energy-efficient lighting, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), may be having a great impact on the health of wildlife. These white LEDs are generated with a high content of short-wavelength ‘blue’ light. While light of any kind can suppress melatonin and the physiological processes it regulates, these short wavelengths are potent suppressors of melatonin. Here, we manipulated the spectral composition of LED lights and tested their capacity to mitigate the physiological and health consequences associated with their use. We experimentally investigated the impact of white LEDs (peak wavelength 448 nm; mean irradiance 2.87 W/m2), long-wavelength shifted amber LEDs (peak wavelength 605 nm; mean irradiance 2.00 W/m2), and no lighting (irradiance from sky glow < 0.37 × 10−3 W/m2), on melatonin production, lipid peroxidation, and circulating antioxidant capacity in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Night-time melatonin and oxidative status were determined at baseline and again following 10 weeks exposure to light treatments. White LED exposed wallabies had significantly suppressed nocturnal melatonin compared to no light and amber LED exposed wallabies, while there was no difference in lipid peroxidation. Antioxidant capacity declined from baseline to week 10 under all treatments. These results provide further evidence that short-wavelength light at night is a potent suppressor of nocturnal melatonin. Importantly, we also illustrate that shifting the spectral output to longer wavelengths could mitigate these negative physiological impacts. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ALAN; anthropogenic disturbance; circadian disruption; Macropus eugenii; melatonin; oxidative stress","Animals; Antioxidants; Color; Female; Light; Lighting; Lipid Peroxidation; Macropodidae; Melatonin; antioxidant; melatonin; animal; blood; color; female; illumination; kangaroo; light; lipid peroxidation; physiology; radiation response","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Antioxidants, ; Melatonin, ","","","Australia and Pacific Science Foundation, APSF, (830178, APSF 15/3); Department of the Environment, Australian Government, (10007502)","Funding text 1: Simon Watson provided advice on data analysis.

Although many negative impacts of ALAN on human health have been identified, the consequences for infectious disease dynamics are largely unexplored. With the increase in popularity of energy efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the effects of spectral composition of ALAN have also come into question. Previous studies showed that exposure to low levels of incandescent ALAN extended the infectious period of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) infected with West Nile virus (WNV) without affecting mortality rates, thus increasing the pathogen initial reproductive rate (R0) by ∼41%. Here, we asked whether exposure to broad-spectrum (3000 K [Kelvin; unit of color temperature]) ALAN suppressed melatonin, a hormone implicated in ALAN-induced physiological consequences, in House Sparrows. We then asked whether amber-hue bulbs (1800 K) could ameliorate the effects of WNV on individual sparrows, and whether broad-spectrum or blue-rich bulbs (3000 K and 5000 K, respectively) could exacerbate them. We found that exposure to low intensity (∼5 lux) broad-spectrum (3000 K) ALAN significantly suppressed melatonin levels throughout the night. Second, we found that exposure to broad-spectrum and blue-rich (3000 + 5000 K) lights did not affect WNV viremia but did increase WNV-induced mortality. Conversely, birds exposed to amber-hue (1800 K) ALAN had lower viremia and mortality rates similar to controls (i.e. natural light conditions). This study demonstrates that ALAN affects melatonin regulation in birds, but this effect, as well as ALAN influences on infectious disease responses, can be ameliorated by particular lighting technologies.  © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press for the American Ornithological Society 2020.","House Sparrow; Immunity; Light pollution; Melatonin; Mortality; Reservoir; Resistance; West Nile virus","","","","","","USF College of Public Health; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1257773); College of Public Health, CPH","Funding text 1: We thank Haley Hanson, Kyle Koller, Bilal Koussayer, Sarah Guzinski, and Samantha Oakey for input on the experimental design and experimental execution.

Extreme exposure of photoperiod i.e. LL and DD has a drastic effect on the immune status of the birds while two long photoperiods 16L:8D and 14L:10D have a significant effect when compared with the immune status of NDL birds. The immune status and melatonin level had a direct relationship but shared an inverse relationship with that of the gonadal activity of the birds. Thus, even in the tropical zone (where the photoperiod is having slight difference) the immunity relies on photoperiodic time measurement mechanisms that include the pineal gland and melatonin to relay photoperiodic changes in physiological and behavioural components of immune function.","Immune status; Melatonin; Photoperiod; Steroid","Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Aves; Perdicula asiatica; melatonin; sex hormone; behavioral ecology; bird; hormone; immune response; inverse analysis; photoperiod; reproduction; tropical region; animal cell; animal experiment; article; controlled study; darkness; environmental exposure; female; gonad; immune response; immune status; Indian; light dark cycle; male; measurement; nonhuman; Perdicula asiatica; photoperiodicity; pineal body; quail; reproduction","","melatonin, 73-31-4","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; Lady Tata Memorial Trust","The authors wish to thank Lady Tata Memorial Trust, Mumbai for financial support to Ms. Sudipta Panshikar and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Bonn, Germany for the equipment.","Bentley G.E., Demas G.E., Nelson R.J., Ball G.F., Melatonin, immuntiy and cost of reproductive state in male European starlings, Proc R Soc, 265, pp. 1191-1195, (1998); Bilbo S.D., Drazen D.L., Quan N., He L., Nelson R.J., Short day length attenuate the symptoms of infection in Siberian Hmasters, Proc Biol Sci, 269, 1490, pp. 447-454, (2002); Blom J.M.C., Gerber J., Nelson R.J., Immune function in deer mice: Developmental and photoperiodic effects, Am J Physiol, 267, (1994); Brainard G.C., Knobler R.L., Podolin P.L., Lavasa M., Lubin F.D., Neuroimmuology: Modulation of the hamster immune system by photoperiod, Life Sci, 40, pp. 1319-1326, (1985); Calvo J.R., Rafii-El-Idrissi M., Pozo D., Guerrero G.M., Immunomodulatory role of melatonin: Specific binding sites in human and lymphoid cells, J Pineal Res, 18, pp. 119-126, (1995); Caroleo M.C., Frasca D., Nistico G., Doria G., Melatonin as immunomodulator in immunodeficient mice, Immunopharmacology, 23, pp. 81-89, (1992); Demas G.E., Nelson R.J., Photoperiod and temperature interacts to affect immune parameters in adult deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), J Biol Rhyth, 11, pp. 94-102, (1996); Farner D.S., Photoperiodic controls in the secretions of gonadotropins in birds, Am Zoologist, 15, 1, pp. 117-135, (1975); Giordano M., Vermeulen M., Palermo M.S., Seasonal variation in antibody cellular cytotoxicity regulation by melatonin, FASEB J, 7, pp. 1052-1054, (1993); Guerrero J.M., Reiter R.J., A brief survey of pineal gland-immune system interrelationships, Endocr Res, 18, pp. 91-113, (1992); Haldar C., Singh S.S., Seasonal changes in melatonin and immunological adaptations in birds, J Endocrinol Reprod, 5, 1, pp. 13-24, (2001); Klieger C.A., Gehad A.E., Hulet R.M., Roush W.B., Lillehoj H.S., Mashaly M.M., Effects of photoperiod and melatonin on lymphocyte activities in male Broiler chickens.

Spectral and acclimation duration (AD) sensitivity were compared between social voles (Microtus socialis) and 'blind' mole rats (Spalax ehrenbergi) in four increasing ADs (0, 1, 7 and 21?days) to LAN (1 30?min, 293?μ?W?cm -2) of three different monochromatic lights [blue (479?nm), yellow (586?nm) and red (697?nm)]. Animals were sampled for urine and oxygen consumption (V O2) promptly after each LAN-AD. Urine samples were analyzed for production rate, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and urinary metabolites of adrenalin and cortisol. Overall, the blue light elicited the greatest effects on the biological markers of M. socialis, whereas similar effects were detected for S. ehrenbergi in response to red light. The increasing LAN-AD resulted in a dose-dependent decrement of all markers tested, except of stress hormones, which showed a direct positive correlation with LAN-AD. Our results suggest that: (1) photoperiod is an important cue for entraining physiological functions in the 'blind' S. ehrenbergi, which is essentially characterized by red-shifted sensitivity compared with the blue-shifted sensitivity detected for the sighted counterpart species, and (2) there is a strong association between LAN of the appropriate wavelength and adrenal endocrine responses, suggesting that LAN is a potential environmental stressor. © 2011.

In laboratory-born squirrels the period of darkness was associated with a gradual rise in pineal melatonin levels with peak values being reached at 0200 h, 6 h after darkness onset. Thereafter, melatonin levels decreased and were back to low daytime levels by 0800 h, 2 h after light onset. The exposure of laboratory-raised animals to an irradiance of 400 μW/cm2 during the night totally prevented the nocturnal rise in pineal melatonin levels in these animals. In wild-captured ground squirrels the period of darkness at night was associated with a rapid rise in pineal melatonin such that by 2200 h, 2 h after lights out, peak melatonin values were already attained; additionally, melatonin levels remained high throughout the period of darkness but returned to daytime values by 0800 h. Exposure of wild-captured squirrels to a light irradiance of 400 μW/cm2 during the normal dark period was completely incapable of suppressing pineal melatonin levels. The difference in the sensitivity of the pineal gland of laboratory-raised and wild-captured ground squirrels may relate to their previous lighting history. © 1983.","","Animal; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Female; Melatonin; Photic Stimulation; Pineal Gland; Sciuridae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Time Factors; melatonin; darkness; sensitivity; squirrel","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, 73-31-4","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (PCM 8003441); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (HD 07139, NF32 ND05900); Max Kade Foundation","Supported by NSF grant no.

We manipulated the night environment and examined cellular and molecular changes in hippocampus, the brain region involved in cognition and mood, of Indian house crows (Corvus splendens) exposed to 12 hr light (150 lux): 12 hr darkness (0 lux). Diurnal corvids are an ideal model species with cognitive abilities at par with mammals. Dim light (6 lux) at night (dLAN) altered daily activity:rest pattern, reduced sleep, and induced depressive-like responses (decreased eating and self-grooming, self-mutilation, and reduced novel object exploration); return to an absolute dark night reversed these negative effects. dLAN suppressed nocturnal melatonin levels; however, diurnal corticosterone levels were unaffected. Concomitant reduction of immunoreactivity for DCX and BDNF suggested dLAN-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and compromised neuronal health. dLAN also negatively influenced hippocampal expression of genes associated with depressive-like responses (bdnf, il-1β, tnfr1, nr4a2), but not of those associated with neuronal plasticity (egr1, creb, syngap, syn2, grin2a, grin2b), cellular oxidative stress (gst, sod3, cat1) and neuronal death (caspase2, caspase3, foxo3). Furthermore, we envisaged the role of BDNF and showed epigenetic modification of bdnf gene by decreased histone H3 acetylation and increased hdac4 expression under dLAN. These results demonstrate transcriptional and epigenetic bases of dLAN-induced negative effects in diurnal crows, and provide insights into the risks of exposure to illuminated nights to animals including humans in an urban setting. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","corvid; depressive-like response; dLAN; mood; sleep","Animals; Biomarkers; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Circadian Rhythm; Corticosterone; Crows; Depression; Gene Expression; Hippocampus; Lighting; Melatonin; Photoperiod; biological marker; brain derived neurotrophic factor; corticosterone; melatonin; adverse event; animal; biosynthesis; blood; circadian rhythm; Corvus; depression; gene expression; genetics; hippocampus; illumination; metabolism; photoperiodicity; physiology","","brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; corticosterone, 50-22-6; melatonin, 73-31-4; Biomarkers, ; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, ; Corticosterone, ; Melatonin, ","","","University Grants Commission, UGC; Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala; University of Delhi, DU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a grant from the Department of Science and Technology under its Cognitive Science Initiative and DU PURSE program, University of Delhi under its R&D Program.; Funding text 2: Department of Science and Technology under its Cognitive Science Initiative and DU PURSE program, University of Delhi under its R&D Program.

To reduce disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep in humans, most smartphones and computers now have software that reduces blue light emissions at night. Little is known about whether reducing blue light emissions from city lights could also benefit urban wildlife. We investigated the effects of blue-rich (white) and blue-reduced (amber) LED streetlights on accelerometry-defined rest, electrophysiologically-identified sleep, and plasma melatonin in a diurnal bird, the black swan (Cygnus atratus). Urban swans were exposed to 20 full nights of each lighting type in an outdoor, naturalistic environment. Contrary to our predictions, we found that night-time rest was similar during exposure to amber and white lights but decreased under amber lights compared with dark conditions. By recording brain activity in a subset of swans, we also demonstrated that resting birds were almost always asleep, so amber light also reduced sleep at night. We found no effect of light treatment on total (24 h) daily rest or plasma melatonin. Our study provides the first electrophysiologically-verified evidence for effects of streetlights on sleep in an urban animal, and furthermore suggests that reducing blue wavelengths of light might not mitigate these effects. © Copyright © 2020 Aulsebrook, Lesku, Mulder, Goymann, Vyssotski and Jones.","accelerometry; artificial light at night; blue light; EEG; elecrophysiology; light pollution; light spectra","","","","","","Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Parks Victoria; BirdLife Australia; Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour, ASAB; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP170101003); Hermon Slade Foundation","The research was conducted at Serendip Wildlife Sanctuary with the permission and support of Parks Victoria.

The levels of this indole exhibited a daily fluctuation similar to that observed in many other vertebrates. Plasma melatonin titers were low during the light phase and elevated during the dark phase when exposed to a lighting regimen of 13 hr light and 11 hr dark. In lizards captured in spring and transferred to this regimen, the amplitude of the plasma melatonin oscillation appeared damped in comparison to those sampled in the autumn. This damping was attributed to higher light phase and lower dark phase concentrations in spring. In one experiment, a correlation between size and plasma melatonin concentration was evident, higher levels being present in smaller animals. In contrast to birds and mammals, where a rhythm in blood melatonin content persists in constant dark, the plasma melatonin rhythm of T. rugosus was abolished by both constant light and constant darkness under constant temperature conditions. © 1979.","","Adaptation, Physiological; Animal; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Light; Lizards; Melatonin; Periodicity; Seasons; melatonin; radioisotope; animal experiment; ecology; photoperiodicity; radioimmunoassay; reptile","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, 73-31-4","","","Sir John Gellibrand Memorial Scholarship; University of Adelaide","We are grateful to Marilyn Campion for her time in performing the statistical analyses and to Dr. R.

It builds upon an earlier investigation which provided equivocal results as to whether an in vivo melatonin rhythm persists in constant dark (DD) and light (LL) and temperature in this species. Using more frequent sampling points and new assay techniques, the present study showed that the melatonin rhythm persisted for at least 6 days at temperatures of 25 and 33°C in constant dark (DD). The melatonin rhythm, however, was largely eliminated in constant light (LL) at 33°C, thereby contradicting some previous findings in other species of reptiles where melatonin levels were apparently insensitive to an unexpected pulse of light at night. These results demonstrate that the sleepy lizard has a persistent, possibly circadian rhythm of melatonin in DD and constant temperature, and that the rhythm is inhibited by LL and constant temperature. Therefore, the sleepy lizard pineal gland may be an independent oscillator capable of driving the melatonin rhythm and be a transducer of the seasonally changing external photothermal environment. © 2006 The Authors.","Circadian; Lighting; Lizard; Melatonin; Pineal; Rhythm; Temperature","Animals; Darkness; Female; Light; Lizards; Male; Melatonin; Radioimmunoassay; melatonin; animal experiment; article; circadian rhythm; environmental temperature; female; hormone blood level; light; light dark cycle; lizard; male; nonhuman; oscillation; pineal body; sampling; technique","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, 73-31-4","","","","","Moore R.Y., Central neural control of circadian rhythms, Front Neuroendocrinol, 5, pp. 185-206, (1978); Oksche A., Evolution of the pineal complex: Correlation of structure and function, Opth Res, 16, pp. 88-95, (1984); Foster R., Provencio I., The regulation of vertebrate biological clocks by light, Adaptive Mechanisms in the Ecology of Vision, pp. 223-243, (1999); Arendt J., Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland, (1995); Falcon J., Cellular circadian clocks in the pineal, Prog Neurobiol, 58, pp. 121-162, (1999); Falcon J., Thibault C., Begay V., Et al., Regulation of the rhythmic melatonin secretion by the fish pineal photoreceptor cells, Rhythms in Fishes, pp. 167-198, (1992); Rawding R.S., Hutchison V.H., Influence of temperature and photoperiod on plasma melatonin in the mudpuppy, Necturus maculosus, Gen Comp Endocrinol, 88, pp. 364-374, (1992); Underwood H., Endogenous rhythms, Biology of the Reptilia, pp. 229-297, (1992); Underwood H., Harless M., Entrainment of the circadian activity rhythm of a lizard to melatonin injections, Physiol Behav, 35, pp. 267-270, (1985); Aschoff J., Exogenous and endogenous components in circadian rhythms, Cold Spring Harbor Symposium in Quant Biol, 25, pp. 11-28, (1960); Bolliet V., Begay V., Ravault J.-P., Et al., Multiple circadian oscillators in the photosensitive pike pineal gland: A study using organ and cell culture, J Pineal Res, 16, pp. 77-84, (1994); Zachman A., Falcon J., Knijft S.C., Et al., Effects of photoperiod and temperature on rhythmic melatonin secretion from the pineal organ of the white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) in vitro, Gen Comp Endocrinol, 86, pp. 26-33, (1992); Samejima M., Tamotsu S., Uchida K., Et al., Melatonin excretion rhythms in the cultured pineal organ of the lamprey, Lampetra japonica, Biol Signals, 6, pp. 241-246, (1997); Iigo M., Fujimoto Y., Gunji-Suzuki M., Et al., Circadian rhythm of melatonin release from the photoreceptive pineal organ of a teleost, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) in flow-thorough culture, J Neuroendocrinol, 16, pp. 45-51, (2004); Menaker M., Wisner S., Temperature compensated circadian clock in the pineal of Anolis, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A Biological Science, 80, pp. 6119-6121, (1983); Moyer R.W., Firth B.T., Kennaway D.J., Effect of constant temperatures, darkness and light on the secretion of melatonin by pineal explants and retinas in the gecko, Christinus marmoratus, Brain Res, 675, pp. 345-348, (1995); Mover R.W., Firth B.T., Kennaway D.J., Effect of variable temperatures, darkness and light on the secretion of melatonin by pineal explants in the gecko, Christinus marmoratus, Brain Res, 747, pp. 230-235, (1997); Bertolucci C., Wagner G., Foa A., Et al., Photoperiod affects amplitude but not duration of in vitro melatonin production in the ruin lizard (Podarcis sicula), J Biol Rhythms, 18, pp. 63-70, (2003); Takahashi J.S., Hamm H., Menaker M., Circadian rhythms of melatonin release from individual superfused pineal glands in vitro, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 77, pp. 2319-2322, (1980); Brandstatter R., Kumar V., Van't Hof T.J., Et al., Seasonal variations of in vivo and in vitro melatonin in a passeriform bird, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), J Pineal Res, 31, pp. 120-126, (2001); Firth B.T., Kennaway D.J., Rozenbilds M.A.M., Plasma melatonin in the scincid lizard Trachydosaurus rugosus: Diel rhythm, seasonality and the effect of constant light and darkness, Gen Comp Endocrinol, 37, pp. 493-500, (1979); Firth B.T., Kennaway D.J., Melatonin content of the pineal, parietal eye and blood plasma of the lizard, Trachydosaurus rugosus: Effect of constant and fluctuating temperature, Brain Res, 404, pp. 313-318, (1987); Voultsios A., Kennaway D.J., Dawson D., Salivary melatonin as a circadian phase marker: Validation and comparison with plasma melatonin, J Biol Rhythms, 12, pp. 457-466, (1997); Firth B.T., Belan I., Daily and seasonal rhythms in selected body temperatures in the Australian lizard Tiliqua rugosa (Scincidae): Field and laboratory observations, Physiol Zool, 71, pp. 303-311, (1998); Tosini G., Bertolucci C., Foa A., The circadian system of reptiles: A multioscillatory and multiphotoreceptive system, Physiol Behav, 72, pp. 461-471, (2001); Underwood H., Calaban M., Pineal melatonin rhythms in the lizard Anolis carolinensis I.

Cryptomys hottentotus pretoriae. This study aimed to assess whether melatonin secretion in this nocturnal, strictly subterranean but seasonally breeding rodent has a day-night rhythm and whether that rhythm is circadian and can be modified by photoperiod. In experiment 1, a day-night rhythm of plasma melatonin was found in all animals housed on a 12L:12D schedule, with significantly higher concentrations in the dark (D) compared with the light (L) phase. The increment of plasma melatonin concentration at night was the same on days 1 and 2 for animals in the control group and animals transferred to constant dark. The animals transferred to constant light substantially reduced the amplitude of the melatonin rhythm on day 2. This suggests that the endogenous melatonin rhythm in C. h. pretoriae has a circadian pattern, which can be synchronized by photoperiod and inhibited by exposure to light at night. In experiment 2, the concentration of plasma melatonin in animals kept under 14L:10D (long day, LD) conditions differed significantly from animals on 10L:14D (short day, SD). This finding supports the notion that C. h. pretoriae is sensitive to changes in day length.","Blind; Circadian; Day-night rhythm; Photoperiod; Subterranean mammal","Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Female;

However, artificial light at night has the potential to interfere with the perception of such natural cues. Following a 5-year study on two populations of wild marsupial mammals exposed to different night-time levels of anthropogenic light, we show that light pollution in urban environments masks seasonal changes in ambient light cues, suppressing melatonin levels and delaying births in the tammarwallaby. These results highlight a previously unappreciated relationship linking artificial light at night with induced changes in mammalian reproductive physiology, and the potential for larger-scale impacts at the population level. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

At higher latitudes (>66°33), continuous illumination during the summer presents a significant time-keeping dilemma for polar-adapted species. Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus), arctic-breeding migratory songbirds, are one of the few recorded species maintaining an intact diel rhythm in activity and plasma melatonin titers during polar summer. However, it is unknown whether rhythms are endogenous and entrain to low-amplitude polar Zeitgeber signals, such as daily variations in light intensity and the spectral composition of the sun (as measured by color temperature). Wild-caught male and female longspurs were brought into captivity, and locomotor activity was assessed using infrared detection. To examine if rhythms were endogenous, birds were exposed to constant bright light (LL; 1300 lux) or constant darkness (DD; 0.1 lux). All birds exhibited free-running activity rhythms in LL and DD, suggesting the presence of a functional circadian clock. Mean periods in LL (22.86 h) were significantly shorter than those in DD (23.5 h), in accordance with Aschoff's rule. No birds entrained to diel changes in light intensity, color temperature, or both. To examine endogenous molecular clock function, the Per2 gene was partially cloned in longspurs (llPer2) and transcripts were measured in hypothalamic tissue punches, eye, and liver using competitive polymerase chain reaction. Ocular llPer2 gene expression was periodic in LL and elevated at ZT24 (CT24) for LD or constant conditions (LL and DD), but llPer2 rhythmicity was not detected in hypothalamus or liver. Plasma melatonin was significantly lower in LL compared with LD or DD. In conclusion, rhythmic ocular Per2 expression and melatonin secretion may maintain the circadian activity rhythm across the polar day. © 2014 The Author(s).","circadian rhythm; clock genes; Lapland longspur; melatonin; Per2","Animals; Arctic Regions; Avian Proteins; Circadian Clocks; Darkness; Eye; Female; Gene Expression; Hypothalamus; Light; Liver; Male; Melatonin; Motor Activity; Period Circadian Proteins; Songbirds; Aves; Calcarius; Calcarius lapponicus; avian protein; circadian rhythm signaling protein; melatonin; animal; Arctic; blood; circadian rhythm; darkness; eye; female; gene expression; genetics; hypothalamus; light; liver; male; metabolism; motor activity; physiology; songbird","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Avian Proteins, ; Melatonin, ; Period Circadian Proteins, ","","","University of Alaska Fairbanks Center for Global Change and Arctic Systems; National Science Foundation, NSF, (OPP 0817635); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (P20GM103436); University of Alaska Anchorage, UAA"," We thank Katie Akpik, Luke George, and Vera Simmonds for field assistance and the staffs at Barrow Arctic Science Consortium and CH2MHill Polar Services for logistical support.

Freshwater fish are exposed to ALAN in large urban and suburban areas in the form of direct light or in the form of skyglow, a diffuse brightening of the night sky through the scattered light reflected by clouds, atmospheric molecules, and particles in the air. However, investigations on the sensitivity of melatonin production of fish towards low intensities of ALAN in the range of typical skyglow are rare. Therefore, we exposed Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) to nocturnal illumination levels of 0.01 lx, 0.1 lx and 1 lx and a control group with dark nights and daylight intensities of 2900 lx in all groups. After ten days of exposure to the experimental conditions, tank water was non-invasively sampled every 3 h over a 24 h period and melatonin was measured by ELISA. Melatonin was gradually reduced in all treatments with increasing intensity of ALAN whereas rhythmicity was maintained in all treatment groups although at 1 lx not all evaluated parameters confirmed rhythmicity. These results show a high sensitivity of Eurasian perch towards ALAN indicating that low light intensities of 0.01 lx and 0.1 lx as they occur in urban and suburban areas in the form of skyglow can affect the physiology of Eurasian perch. Furthermore, we highlight how this may impact perch in their sensitivity towards lunar rhythms and the role of skyglow for biorhythms of temperate freshwater fish. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd; Water-based measurements of melatonin in the Eurasian freshwater fish Perca fluviatilis revealed a reduction even at low intensities of artificial light at night, which provides evidence that the endocrine system is extremely sensitive to skyglow – the most widespread form of light pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circadian rhythm; Dose-response; Freshwater fish; Light pollution; Perca fluviatilis","Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Melatonin; Perches; Arctic Ocean; Eurasian Basin; Animalia; Perca fluviatilis; Vertebrata; Fish; Physiology; Pollution control; Water; Water pollution; melatonin; melatonin; Circadian rhythms; Dose response; Freshwater fishes; Light pollution; Perca fluviatilis; circadian rhythm; concentration (composition); dose-response relationship; freshwater ecosystem; light intensity; light pollution; percid; animal experiment; Article; biological rhythm; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dark adaptation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; freshwater fish; hormone synthesis; illumination; juvenile; light; light dark cycle; light intensity; light pollution; light scattering; night; nonhuman; Perca fluviatilis; photoperiodicity; sunlight; animal; circadian rhythm; perch; Hormones","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ","","","Leibniz-Gemeinschaft, (SAW-2015-IGB-1415)","This work was supported by the ILES project (Illuminating Lake Ecosystems) funded by the Leibniz Association , Germany ( SAW-2015-IGB-1415 ).

Here, we focused on one major urban pollutant – artificial light at night (ALAN) – and its effects on the capacity to mount an innate immune response in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings. Exposure to ALAN alters circadian rhythms of physiological processes, by disrupting the nocturnal production of the hormone melatonin. Nestlings were exposed to a light source emitting 3 lx for seven consecutive nights. Subsequently, nestlings were immune challenged with a lipopolysaccharide injection, and we measured haptoglobin and nitric oxide levels pre- and post-injection. Both haptoglobin and nitric oxide are important markers for innate immune function. We found that ALAN exposure altered the innate immune response, with nestlings exposed to ALAN having lower haptoglobin and higher nitric oxide levels after the immune challenge compared with dark-night nestlings. Unexpectedly, nitric oxide levels were overall lower after the immune challenge than before. These effects were probably mediated by melatonin, as ALAN-treated birds had on average 49% lower melatonin levels than the dark-night birds. ALAN exposure did not have any clear effects on nestling growth. This study provides a potential physiological mechanism underlying the documented differences in immune function between urban and rural birds observed in other studies. Moreover, it gives evidence that ALAN exposure affects nestling physiology, potentially causing long-term effects on physiology and behaviour, which ultimately can affect their fitness. © 2021.

We hypothesised that altering the physiology of urban organisms is due to the effect of extra light at night on the circadian clock by modulating the expression of pineal machinery and clock genes. Two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, immediately after being procured from their respective sites (urban and rural sites), birds were released individually in LLdim light conditions. Circadian rhythm period, activity duration, and total activity count were calculated and did not differ between urban and rural birds. In Experiment 2, birds (from urban and rural habitats) were sampled at six time points at regular 4-h intervals, beginning 1 h after sunrise. We measured daily variations in plasma melatonin levels. We also analysed the expression levels of Aanat, Mel1A and Mel1B as an indicator of melatonin biosynthesis and action machinery. Clock and clock-controlled genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Npas2) were studied in the hypothalamus, the pineal gland, and retina to investigate the effects of urban habitats on the circadian clock. Our results show that there is a lower expression of Aanat in the pineal gland and relatively low plasma melatonin levels in urban birds. Further, clock genes are also differentially expressed in all three central tissues of urban birds. We propose that alterations in the melatonin biosynthesis machinery and the expression of clock genes could result in miscalculations in the internal timing of the organism, with environmental timings leading to altered physiology in urban wild animals. © 2019; Present finding suggest that there is lower secretion of melatonin and altered expression of clock genes in urban birds. © 2019","Clock genes; Hypothalamus; Melatonin; Pineal; Retina; Tree sparrow; Urbanisation","Animals; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Gene Expression; Hypothalamus; Melatonin; Photoperiod; Pineal Gland; Retina; Sparrows; Animalia; Aves; Passer montanus; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Birds; Brain; Clocks; Ecosystems; Forestry; Genes; Hormones; Mechanisms; melatonin; melatonin; Clock genes; Hypothalamus; Melatonin; Pineal; Retina; Tree sparrow; Urbanisation; brain; circadian rhythm; gene expression; hormone; light pollution; passerine; physiological response; pollution effect; urbanization; Aanat gene; adult; animal experiment; Article; biosynthesis; Bmal1 gene; circadian rhythm; clock gene; Cry1 gene; down regulation; gene; gene expression regulation; hypothalamus; male; Mel1A gene; Mel1B gene; nonhuman; Npas2 gene; Passer montanus; Per2 gene; Per3 gene; pineal body; retina; rural area; sparrow; species habitat; urban area; animal; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; photoperiodicity; physiology; Urban growth","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ","","","Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (ECR/2016/000626)","This study was supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi under ECR program ( ECR/2016/000626 ).

We confirmed that the exposure of chipmunks to fluorescent white light of 3,981-4,304 lux during the normal dark period does not prevent the rise in pineal melatonin levels normally associated with darkness. Also, the administration of propranolol (20mg/kg) at 8 p.m. did not block the rise in pineal melatonin in animals exposed to either dark or light at night. Similarly, if chipmunks received propranolol 4 hours into the dark phase, pineal melatonin levels were not depressed 2 hours later. When animals were superior cervical ganglionectomized, however, the pineal content of melatonin remained low regardless of whether the animals were exposed to darkness or light at night. The exposure of chipmunks acutely to light at midnight (4 hours after darkness onset) had only a slight depressive effect on pineal melatonin 30 min later; by comparison, when chipmunks were acutely exposed to light at 3 a.m. (7 hours after darkness onset) daytime pineal melatonin levels were reached within 15 min after light onset. These findings in a diurnal species, the Eastern chipmunk, differ markedly when compared to previously reported observations on nocturnal laboratory rodents. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.","β-adrenergic receptors; Eastern chipmunk; melatonin; Pineal gland; propranolol; superior cervical ganglionectomy","Animal; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Light; Male; Melatonin; Pineal Gland; Propranolol; Sciuridae; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Sympathectomy; melatonin; propranolol; animal experiment; autonomic nervous system; darkness; endocrine system; light; mammal; night; photoperiodicity; pineal body; superior cervical ganglion; sympathectomy","","melatonin, 73-31-4; propranolol, 13013-17-7, 318-98-9, 3506-09-0, 4199-09-1, 525-66-6; Melatonin, 73-31-4; Propranolol, 525-66-6","","","","","Brainard C.G., Richardson B.A., Petterborg L.J., Reiter R.J., The effect of different light intensities on pineal melatonin content, Brain Res., 233, pp. 75-81, (1982); Goldman B., Hall V., Hollister C., Reppert S., Roychoudhury P., Yellon S., Tamarkin L., Diurnal changes in pineal melatonin content in four rodent species: Relationship to photoperiodism, Biol.

Melatonin mediates reproductive and circadian responses and regulates the production of a large number of cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), via modulation of MT1 receptor expression. Maximum pineal activity, resulting in high melatonin level, low melatonin receptor expression, and increased splenic mass, was noted in the winter months, while an opposite effect was noted during the summer months. Further, constant light exposure mimicked an ""enhanced summer""-like condition with significant hyposplenia, and an opposite effect was observed with constant dark exposure with significant splenomegaly in F. pennanti. In the annual study, a slight increase in melatonin level was noted during the monsoon period, when the duration of photoperiod was the same but the amount of solar insolation and direct radiation decreased. The present study found that not only the duration of natural sunlight (i.e., photoperiod) but the intensity of sunlight expressed by solar insolation affects the circulatory level of melatonin and melatonin receptor expression in this wild tropical rodent. An increase in the circulatory level of melatonin induced a decrease in its receptor subtype MT1 expression in splenic cells, both at the transcriptional and translational levels, thus reflecting autoregulatory down-regulation of melatonin receptors. Therefore, in our animal model, F. pennanti melatonin may be suggested as a molecular messenger of photoperiodic signals (duration and intensity) directly acting via MT1 receptor regulation to adapt the immune system of animals residing in the tropical zone. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Melatonin; Melatonin receptors; Photoperiod; Solar insolation","Animals; Gene Expression Regulation; Male; Photoperiod; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1; RNA, Messenger; Sciuridae; Spleen; Sunlight; Time Factors; Animalia; Funambulus pennanti; Rodentia","","RNA, Messenger, ; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1, ","","","University Grants Commission, UGC; Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, BCSIR","The authors are thankful to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and University Grants Commission New Delhi, India, for financial support as Junior Research Fellow and Senior Research Fellow to the first author.

The peak of the melatonin rhythm was entrained by the cryophase temperature of the thermocycle in DD and LL, irrespective of the time at which the cryophase temperature was applied. Comparable thermocycles of 6 h at 15°C imposed on a 12L:12D photocycle, however, affected the amplitude and phase of the melatonin rhythm, depending on the phase relationship between light and temperature. Cold pulses in the early light period and at midday resulted, respectively, either in low amplitude or nonexistent melatonin rhythms, whereas those centered in or around the dark phase elicited rhythms of high amplitude. Supplementary experiments in 12L:12D using two intermittent 6-h 15°C cryophases, one delivered in the midscotophase and another in the midphotophase, elicited melatonin rhythms comparable to those in lizards subjected to constant 33°C and 12L:12D. In contrast, lizards subjected to 12L:12D and a 33°C: 15°C thermocycle, whose thermophase was aligned with the photophase, produced a threefold increase in the amplitude of the melatonin rhythm. Taken together, these results support the notion that there is an interaction between the external light and temperature cycle and a circadian clock in determining melatonin rhythms in Tiliqua rugosa.","Circadian oscillator; Cryophase temperature; Phase shift; Thermoperiodism","melatonin; animal experiment; article; circadian rhythm; cold; controlled study; darkness; female; hormone blood level; hormone release; light dark cycle; lizard; long term exposure; male; nonhuman; priority journal; sunlight; temperature","","melatonin, 73-31-4","","","","","Barrett R.H., Takahashi J.S., Temperature compensation and temperature entrainment of the chick pineal cell circadian clock, J.

In urbanized bird species, light-at-night advances important biological rhythms such as daily cycles of activity/rest and timing of reproduction, but our knowledge of the underlying physiological mechanisms is limited. Given its role as chronobiological signal, melatonin is a strong candidate for mediating the effects of light-at-night. Results: We exposed urban and rural European blackbirds (Turdus merula) to two light treatments equal in photoperiod but with different light intensities at night. The control group was exposed to 0.0001 lux (almost darkness), while the experimental group was exposed to 0.3 lux at night, simulating conditions recorded previously on free-living urban blackbirds. We obtained diel profiles of plasma melatonin for all birds in summer (July) and winter (January), while simultaneously recording locomotor activity. Daily patterns of melatonin concentrations were clearly affected by light-at-night in both seasons. In winter, melatonin concentrations of light-at-night birds were lower in the early and late night than in those of birds kept in darkness. In summer, melatonin concentrations of the light-at-night birds were lower through all night compared to birds kept in darkness. Locomotor activity in light-at-night birds was overall higher than in control individuals, both during the day and at night, and it increased sharply before dawn. In winter, the amount of activity before dawn in the light-at-night group correlated with changes in melatonin from midnight to late night: the greater the decrease in melatonin, the greater the amount of pre-dawn activity. Urban and rural birds responded similarly to light-at-night with respect to melatonin, but differed in their behaviour, with rural birds showing more locomotor activity than urban counterparts. Conclusions: This study points to reduced melatonin release at night as a potential physiological mechanism underlying the advanced onset of morning activity of urbanized birds. Based on the pattern of melatonin secretion, we suggest that birds responded to light-at-night as if they were exposed to a longer day than birds kept under dark nights. © 2013 Dominoni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Birds; Circadian rhythms; GnIH; Light-at-night; Locomotor activity; Melatonin; Timing of reproduction; Urbanization","Aves; Passeri; Turdus merula","","","","","Baden-Württemberg Stiftung; Volkswagen Foundation","J.P. was funded by Volkswagen Foundation (“Initiative Evolutionary Biology”).

Under light-dark (LD) cycles of 12:12 hr, melatonin levels in the oikawa eye exhibited daily rhythms with higher levels during the dark phase than those during the light phase. However, the rhythms disappeared under either constant light (LL) or constant darkness (DD). Ocular melatonin contents under LL remained at low levels while those under DD kept high titers. These results indicate ocular melatonin rhythms in oikawa are driven not by a circadian clock but by LD cycles.","","Cyprinidae; Teleostei; Zacco platypus","","","","","","","Besharse J.C., Iuvone P.M., Pierce M.E., Regulation of rhythmic photoreceptor metabolism: A role for post-receptoral neurons, Prog Retinal Res, 7, pp. 21-61, (1988); Binkley S.A., The Pineal: Endocrine and Nonendocrine Function, (1987); Bolliet V., Ali M.A., Lapointe F.J., Falcon J., Rhythmic melatonin secretion in different teleost species: An in vitro study, J Comp Physiol B, 165, pp. 677-683, (1996); Blazynski C., Dubocovich M.L., Localization of 2-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodomelatonin binding sites in mammalian retina, J Neurochem, 56, pp. 1873-1880, (1991); Cahill G.M., Circadian regulation of melatonin production in cultured zebrafish pineal and retina, Brain Res, 708, pp. 177-181, (1996); Cahill G.M., Grace M.S., Besharse J.C., Rhythmic regulation of retinal melatonin: Metabolic pathways, neurochemical mechanisms, and ocular circadian clock, Cell Mol Neurobiol, 11, pp. 529-560, (1991); Cheze G., Ali M.A., Rôle de l'épiphyse dans la migration du pigment épithelial rétinien chez quelques téléostéens, Can J Zool, 54, pp. 475-481, (1976); Dubocovich M.L., Role of melatonin in retina, Prog Retinal Res, 8, pp. 129-151, (1988); Falcon J., Begay V., Goujon J.M., Voisin P., Guerlotte J., Collin J.P., Imunocytochemical localisation of hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase in pineal photoreceptor cells of several fish species, J Comp Neurol, 341, pp. 559-566, (1994); Falcon J., Collin J.P., Pineal-retinal relationships: Rhythmic biosynthesis and immunocytochemical localization of melatonin in the retina of the pike (Esox lucius), Cell Tissue Res, 265, pp. 601-609, (1991); Falcon J., Thibault C., Begay V., Zachmann A., Collin J.P., Regulation of the rhythmic melatonin secretion by fish pineal photoreceptor cells, Rhythms in Fishes, 236, pp. 167-198, (1992); Gern W.A., Gorell T.A., Owens D.W., Melatonin and pigment cell rhythmicity, Adv Biosci, 29, pp. 223-233, (1980); Gern W.A., Greenhouse S.S., Nervina J.M., Gasser P.J., The rainbow trout pineal organ: An endocrine photometer, Rhythms in Fishes, 236, pp. 199-218, (1992); Gern W.A., Owens D.W., Ralph C.L., The synthesis of melatonin by trout retina, J Exp Zool, 206, pp. 263-270, (1978); Iigo M., Studies on Melatonin Rhythms in Fishes, (1996); Iigo M., Aida K., Effects of season, temperature and photoperiod on plasma melatonin rhythms in the goldfish, Carassius auratus, J Pineal Res, 18, pp. 62-68, (1995); Iigo M., Furukawa K., Hattori A., Ohtani-Kaneko R., Hara M., Suzuki T., Tabata M., Aida K., Ocular melatonin rhythms in the goldfish, Carassius auratus, J Biol Rhythms, 12, pp. 182-192, (1997); Iigo M., Kezuka H., Suzuki T., Tabata M., Aida K., Melatonin signal transduction in the goldfish, Carassius auratus, Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 18, pp. 563-569, (1994); Iigo M., Kitamura S., Ikuta K., Sanchez-Vazquez F.J., Ohtani-Kaneko R., Hara M., Hirata K., Tabata M., Aida K., Regulation by light and darkness of melatonin secretion from the superfused masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) pineal organ, Biol Rhythm Res, (1997); Janik D.S., Menaker M., Circadian locomotor rhythms in the desert iguana.

In order to elucidate the effect of prolonged constant condition and the differences in the response between nocturnal and diurnal species, we studied the effects of constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) on a diurnal (squirrel) and a nocturnal (mouse) rodent species, focusing on the endocrine, inflammatory and antioxidant systems associated with depression-like behavior. Squirrels and mice (n = 10/group) were placed in chronocubicle under 12:12 h LD cycle, LL and DD. After 4 weeks, animals were subjected to sucrose preference test and blood and brain tissues were collected for measuring melatonin, corticosterone, proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the activity of primary antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results show that in diurnal squirrels, prolonged constant darkness reduced sucrose preference, CAT, and SOD, increased corticosterone and TNF-α levels, but caused no significant change in the melatonin compared to LD condition. In contrast, in nocturnal mice constant darkness caused no significant changes in sucrose preference and corticosterone levels, increased melatonin, CAT and SOD levels but decreased TNF-α levels. Chronic LL caused a similar response in both squirrels and mice: it decreased sucrose preference, melatonin, CAT and SOD levels but increased corticosterone and TNF-α levels. Together, the study demonstrates differential effects of altered light-dark cycle in a diurnal and a nocturnal rodent on interrelated endocrine, inflammatory and antioxidant systems associated with depression-like behavior, with constant light having adverse effects on both species but constant darkness having a negative effect mainly in the diurnal squirrels. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","constant darkness; constant light; Diurnal; nocturnal; squirrels","Animals; Antioxidants; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Light; Mice; Photoperiod; Sciuridae; antioxidant; animal; circadian rhythm; darkness; light; mouse; photoperiodicity; Sciuridae","","Antioxidants, ","","","CSIR-UGC; DST-FIST; ISF-UGC, (992/); ISLS-BHU; UGC-CAS; UGC-ISF; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR, (09/013/(0717)/2017-EMR-I); University Grants Commission, UGC; University Grants Committee, UGC; Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (037261)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation; University Grants Commission.

The few existing studies on neuronal plasticity and cognitive functions in mammals indicate that a disruption of the circadian cycle impairs learning and memory and suppresses neurogenesis. However, nothing is known about the effect of ALAN on neuronal plasticity in birds. To this end, zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were exposed to ecologically relevant ALAN intensities (0.5, 1.5 and 5 lx), treated with BrdU to quantify cell proliferation in their ventricular zone (VZ), and compared to controls that were kept under dark nights. We found, in our diurnal birds, that ALAN significantly increased cell proliferation in the VZ. However, neuronal densities in two brain regions decreased under ALAN, suggesting neuronal death. In addition, ALAN suppressed nocturnal melatonin production in a dose-dependent manner, and might also increase body mass. Taken together, our findings add to the notion of the deleterious effect of ALAN. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial light at night (ALAN); Cell proliferation; Circadian cycle; Melatonin; Neuronal densities; Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata)","Animals; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Circadian Rhythm; Finches; Light; Melatonin; Neuronal Plasticity; broxuridine; melatonin; melatonin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; artificial light at night; body mass; brain region; cell density; cell proliferation; controlled study; corpus striatum; darkness; female; hippocampus; hormone blood level; hormone synthesis; immunohistochemistry; light; light intensity; nerve cell; nerve cell plasticity; neuroapoptosis; nidopallium caudale; night; nonhuman; priority journal; subventricular zone; Taeniopygia guttata; adverse event; animal; brain; cell proliferation; circadian rhythm; finch; light; metabolism; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; radiation response","","broxuridine, 59-14-3; melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ","","","Open University Research Fund; The Slovak Research and Development Agency, (APVV-17-0178); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (132/18)","This research was supported by The Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 132/18 ), The Slovak Research and Development Agency ( APVV-17-0178 ), and The Open University Research Fund .

Light is a continuous variable, but our knowledge on how individuals react to different light intensities during the night is limited. We therefore determined the relationship between night light intensity and the behaviour and physiology of great tits (Parus major). We measured daily activity patterns and melatonin levels in 35 males exposed to five different light intensities and found strong, dose-dependent effects. Activity onset was increasingly advanced, and activity offset delayed with higher light intensities. Furthermore, night-time activity increased and melatonin levels measured at midnight decreased with higher intensities. In this experimental study, we demonstrate for the first time dose-dependent effects of artificial light at night on birds' daily activity patterns and melatonin levels. Our results imply that these effects are not limited to a certain threshold, but emerge even when nocturnal light levels are slightly increased. However, in a natural area, these effects may be limited as artificial light levels are commonly low; light intensities drop rapidly with distance from a light source and birds can avoid exposure to light at night. Future studies should thus focus on examining the impact of different intensities of light at night in the wild. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial light at night; Circadian rhythm; Dose-response; Great tit; Light intensity; Melatonin","Actigraphy; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Lighting; Male; Melatonin; Motor Activity; Photic Stimulation; Photoperiod; Songbirds; melatonin; melatonin; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; dose response; light exposure; light intensity; male; night; nonhuman; Parus major; physiology; priority journal; protein blood level; rhythm; actimetry; adverse effects; animal; circadian rhythm; illumination; metabolism; motor activity; photoperiodicity; photostimulation; songbird","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ","","","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DBI-1306025); Ministerie van Economische Zaken, EZ; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen, STW; Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij voor Diergeneeskunde, KNMvD","We thank Marylou Aaldering and Franca Kropman for taking good care of our experimental birds, Gilles Wijlhuizen and Jeroen Laurens for technical assistance during the study and Barbara Helm and Davide Dominoni for fruitful discussions about the set-up of the experiment and comments on the manuscript.

CL had no effect on pineal, thyroid and ovarian functions as judged by weight, plasma level of thyroxine (T4) and estradiol (E2). However, CD reduced significantly thyroid and ovarian weight and plasma T4, and E2 levels. Px was stimulatory for thyroid and ovarian functions under normal photoperiod, and under CL, Px significantly increased thyroid and ovarian weights with no observable changes in their hormonal levels. Px under CD condition prevented the reduction in thyroid and ovarian weights but the hormonal levels were increased. These results suggest that CD could be a effective stimulator for the pineal function and increased pineal activity in this mammal. The inhibitory effect of CD on thyroid and ovarian functions could be due to the increased pineal activity in term of induced melatonin by CD itself.","Constant light; Darkness; Melatonin; Pinealectomy; Thyroxine and estradiol","Animals; Body Weight; Darkness; Estradiol; Female; India; Light; Organ Size; Ovary; Pineal Gland; Reference Values; Reproduction; Sciuridae; Thyroid Gland; Thyroxine; estradiol; thyroxine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; darkness; estradiol blood level; estrus cycle; female; light; light dark cycle; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; organ weight; ovary function; pineal body; pinealectomy; priority journal; squirrel; thyroid gland; thyroid weight; thyroxine blood level","","Estradiol, 50-28-2; Thyroxine, 7488-70-2","","","","","Arendt J., Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland, pp. 67-109, (1995); Attanasio A., Borelli P., Gupta D., Circadian rhythms in serum melatonin from infancy to adolescence, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 61, pp. 388-389, (1985); Benson B., Satterfield V., Ultrastructural characterstics of mouse pinealocytes following optic enucleation or continuous illumination, Anat Rec, 181, 2, pp. 231-239, (1975); Binkley S., Structures and molecules involved in generation and regulation of biological rhythms in vertebrates and invertebrates, Experentia, 49, pp. 648-653, (1993); Fiske V.M., Bryant G.K., Putnam J., Effect of light on the weight of the pineal in the rat, Endocrinology, 66, pp. 489-494, (1960); Haldar-Misra C., Methods of pinealectomy in vertebrates, Ind J Exp Biol, 24, pp. 319-322, (1986); Haldar C., Shavali S.S., Singh S., Photoperiodic response of pineal-thyroid axis of the female Indian palm squirrel, Funambulus pennanti, J Neural Transm, 90, (1992); Quay W.B., Photic modification of mammalian pineal weight and composition and its anatomical basis, Anat Res, 139, pp. 265-279, (1961); Quay W.B., Reduction of mammalian pineal weight and lipid during continuous light, Gen Comp Endocrinol, 1, pp. 211-217, (1961); Reiter R.J., The Pineal Gland: Comprehensive Endocrinology, (1984); Reiter R.J., Pineal melatonin: Cell biology of its synthesis and of its physiology interactions, Endocr Rev, 12, pp. 151-180, (1991); Reiter R.J., Richardson B.A., Vaughan M.K., Johnson L.Y., Pineal actions and mechanisms in reproductive physiology, Jikeikai Med J, 28, 1 SUPPL., pp. 35-46, (1981); Reiter R.J., Guerrero J.M., Rubino A., Thyroxine metabolism in the mammalian pineal gland, Melatonin and the Pineal Gland: from Basic Science to Clinical Application, pp. 55-58, (1993); Rudeen P.K., Reiter R.J., Influence of a skeleton photoperiod on the male golden hamster, J Reprod Fert, 60, pp. 279-283, (1980); Snedecor G.W., Cocharan W.G., Statistical Methods, pp. 593-620, (1967); Stehle J.H., Fanlkes N.S., Holina C.A., Semmoneaux V., Pevet P., Sassone-Corsi P., Adrenergic signals direct rhythmic expression of transcriptional repressor cREM in the pineal gland, Nature, 365, pp. 314-327, (1993); Steinlechner S., Nikolwitz P., Impact of photoperiod and melatonin on reproduction in small mammals, Ann Reprod Sci, 30, pp. 1-28, (1992); Vriend J., Testing the TRH hypothesis of pineal function, Med Hyp, 4, pp. 376-387, (1978); Wurtman R.J., Axelrod J., Kelly D.E., The Pineal, (1968)","","","","","","","","","03009564","","JNTRF","9720970","English","J.

The pineal melatonin rhythm and its regulation by light in a subterranean rodent, the valley pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae). J. Pineal Res. 1994; 16: 145–153. The daytime and nighttime levels of pineal N‐acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, hydroxyindole‐O‐methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity, and melatonin were measured in adult male and female valley pocket gophers, Thomomys bottae. This species was chosen for study because it is a subterranean rodent that inhabits burrows whose openings to the surface are closed. Therefore, under field conditions it is estimated that the pocket gopher spends roughly 99% of its time in absolute darkness in underground burrows. When wild captured pocket gophers were maintained under a light dark cycle (light intensity during the day of roughly 140 μ,W/cm2), nighttime levels of pineal NAT activity and melatonin content were higher than values measured during the day; on the other hand, HIOMT activity in the pineal gland was similar in the day and at night. When pocket gophers were exposed to an extended light period (220 μW/cm2) 4 hr into the night, the rise in melatonin synthesis normally associated with darkness onset was not inhibited. Also, when gophers were acutely exposed to a light intensity of 400 μW/cm2 for 1 hr beginning 4 hr after darkness onset, neither high nocturnal levels of pineal NAT nor pineal melatonin contents were reduced. Finally, when pocket gophers were exposed to a 600 (μW/cm2 light intensity at either 4 hr or 8 hr into the dark period, pineal melatonin synthesis remained elevated at a level comparable to that measured in dark‐exposed controls. The results show that under controlled laboratory conditions the pineal gland of the valley pocket gopher, a species that in its natural habitat spends about 99% of its time in absolute darkness, exhibits higher melatonin synthesis during night than during the day. While the rhythm in pineal melatonin production in the pocket gopher is clearly synchronized by the prevailing light: dark cycle, high nighttime pineal melatonin synthesis is not readily inhibited by light in the intensity range of 220 to 600μW/cm2. In terms of its relative insensitivity to light at night, the pineal gland of the valley pocket gopher resembles that of other diurnally active rodents. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

The present study on Indian weaver bird (Ploceus philippinus) investigated if exposure to bright light at different phases of night affects their clock-mediated daily functions. Birds were placed individually in specially designed activity cages under short days and long nights (8L:16D; L = 100 lux, D < 0.1 lux) for ∼3 weeks (19 days). Thereafter, they were divided into four groups (n = 6–9), and given ∼2 lux light either for the entire night (ZT 08–24; zeitgeber time 0 = time of light on; pattern A) or for 4 hr (pattern B), placed in 16 hr night such that its onset coincides with the onset of night (early night group, ZT 08–12), its end with the end of night (late night group, ZT 20–24), or the night was interrupted in the middle (midnight group, ZT 14–18). The results showed that bright light in entire night induced early onset of day activity and fragmented rest at night, however, if given at different phases of night, it made the days longer by delaying end (early night group) or advancing onset of daily activity (late night group). It also suppressed the melatonin levels and increased body temperature. These results suggest that bright light at night alters the perception of daylength and affects the underlying physiology. The findings may be useful in adopting a strategy for use of night light without disturbing species fitness in their environment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bright light at night; locomotor activity; melatonin; temperature; weaver bird","Animals; Body Temperature; Light; Lighting; Locomotion; Melatonin; Passeriformes; Photoperiod; Seasons; melatonin; animal; blood; body temperature; illumination; light; locomotion; Passeriformes; photoperiodicity; physiology; radiation response; season","","melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ","","","Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology; Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India, (BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012); University Grants Commission, UGC, (201112-RGNF-SC-UTT-11960)","Funding text 1: Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012; University Grants Commission, Grant/Award Number: 201112-RGNF-SC-UTT-11960; Funding text 2: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions to help us improve quality of the manuscript.

Temperate migratory blackheaded buntings (Emberiza melanocephala) and subtropical non-migratory Indian weaverbirds (Ploceus philippinus) initially entrained to 12h light:12h darkness (12L:12D; L=0.33μM/m2/s, D=0μM/m2/s) in two groups of each, groups 1 and 2, were subjected to constant light (LL, 0.33μM/m2/s), which rendered them arrhythmic in the activity behavior. They were then exposed for about two weeks each to 12B:12R and 12R:12B (group 1) or 12R:12B and 12B:12R (group 2) at 0.33μM/m2/s light energy level. Blue and red light periods were interpreted as the day and night, respectively, with activity and no-activity in non-migratory weaverbirds or activity and intense activity (Zugunruhe, migratory night restlessness) in the migratory buntings. Consistent with this, plasma melatonin levels under B:R, not R:B, light cycle were low and high in blue and red light periods, respectively. A similar diurnal pattern was absent in the cortisol levels, however. These results show an important role of light wavelengths in synchronization of the circadian clock governed behavior and physiology to the photoperiodic environment, and suggest that photoperiodic timing might be a conserved physiological adaptation in many more birds, regardless of the difference in breeding latitudes, than has been generally envisaged. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Activity; Bunting; Cortisol; Light wavelength; Melatonin; Weaver bird","Analysis of Variance; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Hydrocortisone; Light; Melatonin; Motor Activity; Photoperiod; Songbirds; Species Specificity; Statistics as Topic; hydrocortisone; melatonin; hydrocortisone; melatonin; animal experiment; Article; circadian rhythm; controlled study; darkness; Emberiza melanocephala; hormone blood level; hydrocortisone blood level; latitude; light; light intensity; light wavelength; melatonin blood level; nonhuman; Ploceus philippinus; red light; songbird; species difference; analysis of variance; animal; blood; circadian rhythm; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; motor activity; photoperiodicity; physiology; radiation response; songbird; statistics","","hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; melatonin, 73-31-4; Hydrocortisone, ; Melatonin, ","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SR/CSI/03/2010(20) G )); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR, (37(1430)/10/EMR-II/2011); University Grants Commission, UGC, (36-268/2008); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (IR/SO/LU/02-2005, R)/2012/1477)","Financial support from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi ( 37(1430)/10/EMR-II/2011 ), Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi ( SR/CSI/03/2010(20) G ), Science and Engineering Research Board ( IR/SO/LU/02-2005 ) through IRHPA Center for Excellence in Biological Rhythm Research grant, DU-DST PURSE ( Dean (R)/2012/1477 ) grant, and University Grants Commission, New Delhi ( 36-268/2008 ) are gratefully acknowledged.

However, under culture conditions, haddock will sexually mature prior to the attainment of a suitable harvest weight. Therefore, a long term tank based experiment was performed where three populations of haddock (hatched spring 2002, approximately 150 fish per population) were exposed to either a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) or SNP until January or July 2003 and thereafter continuous illumination (Jan LL or July LL respectively) with individual growth rate and maturation status being recorded until July 2004 (27 months post-hatch). While the SNP treated population matured in the spring of 2004 (two years post-hatch) with 88% of the population being observed to release gametes, no mature individuals were observed in either of the LL treated populations and furthermore there was no evidence of gonadal development or elevation in sex steroids (testosterone, estradiol-17β or calcium). The application of LL appeared to directly stimulate the growth rate of haddock (e.g. 14 to 27% increase in weight thermal growth coefficient) and improve food conversion rates. At the end of the trial there was an approximate 50% increase in wet weight (SNP: 647 ± 53 g, Jan LL: 982 ± 34 g and July LL 985 ± 33 g), however no significant difference in weight in relation to the length of LL exposure was observed. Plasma melatonin analysis revealed that the natural diel rhythm had been inhibited in both LL treated populations. Along with highlighting the similarity in reproductive entrainment between haddock and other gadoids, these results demonstrate how photoperiod manipulation could be used as a management strategy to improve growth performance in farmed haddock stocks. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies on the rhythmicity of these hormones were conducted under various LD cycles, but with a constant temperature, raising the question of the role of the natural thermocycle in determining the phase of the rhythms, and the changes that occur in the hormone levels and rhythms during late metamorphosis. To study this question, tadpoles were acclimated to simulated natural conditions of 14.5L:9.5D with a corresponding thermocycle in which the thermophase was 28°C and the cryophase was 18°C, or to the same thermocycle under constant light (24L). On both photoregimens, the diel fluctuations changed between prometamorphosis and metamorphic climax. However, more statistically significant rhythms, as indicated by the cosinor, occurred on 14.5L:9.5D than on 24L. At climax on the LD cycle, all hormones peaked around the same time in the late scotocryophase, whereas on 24L, plasma T4 peaked in the thermophase and plasma and ocular melatonin peaks occurred some distance from each other early in the cryophase. The earlier peaks of plasma and ocular melatonin on 24L were due to a transient rise in these hormones at the onset of the cryophase, which was not sustained in the absence of an LD cycle. On 14.5L:9.5D with a corresponding thermocycle, the hormone rhythms had nearly the same phases as was found in previous work on 12L:12D at a constant temperature of 22°C, allowing for minor phase shifting due to the photocycle differences, indicating that in this species laboratory studies on constant temperature give valid results even in the absence of a thermocycle. The findings show that the phases of the hormone rhythms are determined by the LD cycle although the onset of the cryophase, in the absence of a photocycle, may exert some influence on the nighttime rise in melatonin. The developmental rise in plasma T4, and drop in plasma melatonin, occurred on both 14.5L:9.5D and 24L, indicating, taken together with previous work, that these climactic changes were independent of temperature and light cycling. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Conversely, the 10 h dark period was associated with large nocturnal rises in both pineal serotonin-N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and radioimmunoassayable melatonin levels. The nighttime rises in pineal NAT and melatonin were not suppressed by the exposure of the animals to a light irradiance of 925 μW/cm2 during the normal dark period. On the other hand, when the light irradiance was increased to 1850 μW/cm2 the rise in pineal NAT activity was eliminated while the melatonin rise was greatly reduced. When ground squirrels were acutely exposed to a light irradiance of 1850 μW/cm2 for 30 min beginning at 5.5 h after lights out, pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels were reduced to daytime values within 30 min. The half-time (t 1 2) for each constituent was less than 10 min. Exposure to a light irradiance of either 5 s or 5 min (beginning at 5.5 h intoim dark period) was equally as effective as 30 min light exposure in inhibiting pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels. When animals were returned to darkness after a 30 min exposure to a light irradiance of 1850 μW/cm2 at night, both pineal NAT activity and melatonin levels were restored to high nighttime levels within 2 h of their return to darkness. The results indicate that the pineal gland of the wild-captured, diurnal Richardson's ground squirrel is 9000× less sensitive to light at night than is the pineal gland of the laboratory raised, nocturnal Syrian hamster. © 1983.","hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase; irradiance; light; melatonin; N-acetyltransferase; pineal","Acetylserotonin N-Methyltransferase; Acetyltransferases; Animal; Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Kinetics; Light; Melatonin; Methyltransferases; Pineal Gland; Sciuridae; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; acetylserotonin methyltransferase; arylamine acetyltransferase; melatonin; radioisotope; acetylserotonin methyltransferase; Acetylserotonin N Methyltransferase; acyltransferase; arylamine acetyltransferase; melatonin; methyltransferase; animal experiment; central nervous system; endocrine system; light exposure; mammal; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; pineal body; radioimmunoassay; animal; article; circadian rhythm; darkness; kinetics; light; metabolism; pineal body; Sciuridae","","acetylserotonin methyltransferase, 9029-77-0; arylamine acetyltransferase, 9027-33-2; melatonin, 73-31-4; acyltransferase, 9012-30-0, 9054-54-0; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; Acetylserotonin N-Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.4; Acetyltransferases, EC 2.3.1.; Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5; Melatonin, 73-31-4; Methyltransferases, EC 2.1.1.","","","","","Axelrod, Wurtman, Snyder, Control of hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity in the rat pineal gland by environmental lighting, J. biol.

This fish buries itself in the bottom sand during the subjective-night, thereby suggesting that behaviorally it adjusts its circadian clock to avoid photoreception. In this study, we determined ocular melatonin contents of the wrasse under various photic environments and used ocular melatonin to indicate photoreception. Under light-dark (LD) cycles, ocular melatonin contents of the wrasse exhibited a daily rhythm, with higher levels during the dark phase than those during the light phase. The duration of nocturnal melatonin elevation was longer under LD 9:15 than under LD 15:9. Acute exposure to 2-h light during the dark phase resulted in a significant decrease in ocular melatonin at mid-dark in an intensity-dependent manner. However, acute exposure to different intensities of light for 2h during the light phase had only a small effect on ocular melatonin contents at mid-day. Under LL, ocular melatonin contents in the wrasse reared with bottom sand present exhibited circadian rhythms and were significantly higher than those with transluscent acryl pellets on the bottom. These results indicate that the ocular melatonin rhythm in the wrasse is driven both by the photic environment and by a circadian clock, and that the wrasse that buries itself in the bottom sand can perceive low intensity of light. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Amongst the possible factors that influence this advance (e.g., food availability, microclimate, predator regime, etc.), is exposure to artificial lights at night (LAN). LAN could stimulate the reproductive axis of the suburban jays. Alternatively, LAN could inhibit pineal melatonin (MEL), thus removing its inhibitory influence on the reproductive axis. Because Florida scrub-jays are a threatened species, we used western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) to investigate the effects of LAN upon reproductive hormones and melatonin. Jays were held under conditions in which the dark-phase of the light:dark cycle was without illumination and then under low levels of LAN. Under both conditions, birds were exposed first to short-days (9.5L:14.5D) that were gradually increased to long-days (14.5L:9.5D). At various times, blood samples were collected during the light part of the cycle to measure reproductive hormones (luteinizing hormone, LH; testosterone, T; and estradiol, E2). Similarly, samples to assess melatonin were collected during the dark. In males, LAN caused a depression in LH levels and levels were ∼4× greater under long- than short-days. In females, there was no effect of LAN or photoperiod upon LH. LAN resulted in depressed T levels in females, although there was no effect on T in males. E2 levels in both sexes were lower under LAN than under an unlighted dark-phase. Paradoxically, MEL was higher in jays under LAN, and under long-days. MEL did not differ by sex. LAN disrupted the extraordinarily strong correlation between T and E2 that existed under unlighted nocturnal conditions. Overall, our findings fail to support the hypothesis that LAN stimulates the reproductive axis. Rather, the data demonstrate that LAN tends to inhibit reproductive hormone secretion, although not in a consistent fashion between the sexes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Animals; Corticosterone;

The exposure of animals to an artificial‐light irradiance of 160,000 μW/cm2 during darkness for either 1 s, 5 s, or 30 min was followed by a precipitous decline in pineal NAT activity and melatonin content when measured at either 15 or 30 min after light onset. When cotton rats were acutely exposed to light at night for 5 s, irradiances of either 3.2, 32, 320, and 3,200 did not suppress either pineal NAT or melatonin 30 min later; however, if the 5‐s exposure had an irradiance of either 32,000 or 160,000 μW/cm2, the pineal enzyme activity and indole content were depressed. Moonlight, which had a maximal irradiance of 0.32 μW/cm2, was unable to suppress pineal NAT activity and melatonin content even when the animals were exposed to the moonlight for 30 min. The treatment of cotton rats with either norepinephrine or its agonist, isoproterenol, before their exposure to light at night retarded slightly the suppressive effect of light on the pineal constituents measured. Also, these drug treatments suppressed the pre‐exposure levels of both NAT activity and melatonin content in the cotton rat pineal gland. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

Under alternating light-dark conditions (light:dark hours 14:10), pineal sen tonin and melatonin levels exhibited a rhythm with high values occurring either during the day (serotonin) or during th night (melatonin). NAT activity was also markedly increased during darkness. HIOMT activity exhibited no 24-hour variation. Exposure of squirrels to constant light for 7 days exaggerated the serotonin rhythm, but obliterated the cycles of NAT and melatonin. Under constant darkness (for 7 days), the rhythms in serotonin, melatonin and NAT persisted, each having a period of about 24 h. In the second study, ground squirrels were exposed to light-dark cycles of either 8:16, 10:14 or 14:10. Under each of these photoperiodic environments, rhythms in pineal NAT and melatonin were apparent. Increasing the daily dark period from 10 to 14 h caused a prolongation of the elevated NAT and melatonin levels. However, further prolongation of the daily dark period (to 16 h) did not further increase the duration of the rise in NAT and melatonin. The results show that continual light exposure (irradiance of 200 μW/cm2) for 7 days suppresses the pineal rhythms in both NAT activity and melatonin level in the Richardson's ground squirrel. Conversely, light exposure, rather than depressing the serotonin rhythm, actually exaggerates it. Constant darkness for 7 days has little influence on tlu 24-hour rhythms of either NAT or melatonin. In the Richardson's ground squirrel, it appears that the quantity of melatonin formed may be in part related to the duration of the daily dark period. © 1984 S.
