These white lights typically require less energy to operate and are therefore considered “eco-friendly”. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts white lights may have upon local wildlife populations. We compared insect attraction to orange (high-pressure sodium, HPS) and white (metal halide, MH and LED) street lights experimentally using portable street lights and custom-made flight intercept traps. Significantly more (greater than five times as many) insects were attracted to white MH street lights than white (4,250 K) LED and HPS lights. There was no statistical difference in the numbers of insects attracted to LED and HPS lights for most taxa caught. However, rarefaction shows a greater diversity of insects caught at LED than HPS lights. Policy implications. With the current, large-scale conversion to white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, our results give insight into how changes to street light technology may affect wildlife populations and communities. We recommend avoiding metal halide light installations as they attract many more insects than competing technologies. We highlight the need to tailor LED lighting to prevent disturbances across multiple insect taxa. © 2017 The Authors.

However, datasets to support detailed along-coast assessments of framework production rates and accretion potential do not presently exist. Here, we estimate, based on gross bioaccretion and bioerosion measures, the carbonate budgets and resultant estimated accretion rates (EAR) of the shallow reef zone of leeward Bonaire – between 5 and 12 m depth – at unique fine spatial resolution along this coast (115 sites). Whilst the fringing reef of Bonaire is often reported to be in a better ecological condition than most sites throughout the wider Caribbean region, our data show that the carbonate budgets of the reefs and derived EAR varied considerably across this ~58 km long fringing reef complex. Some areas, in particular the marine reserves, were indeed still dominated by structurally complex coral communities with high net carbonate production (>10 kg CaCO3 m−2 year−1), high live coral cover and complex structural topography. The majority of the studied sites, however, were defined by relatively low budget states (<2 kg CaCO3 m−2 year−1) or were in a state of net erosion. These data highlight the marked spatial heterogeneity that can occur in budget states, and thus in reef accretion potential, even between quite closely spaced areas of individual reef complexes. This heterogeneity is linked strongly to the degree of localized land-based impacts along the coast, and resultant differences in the abundance of reef framework building coral species. The major impact of this variability is that those sections of reef defined by low-accretion rates will have limited capacity to maintain their structural integrity and to keep pace with current projections of climate change induced sea-level rise (SLR), thus posing a threat to reef functioning and biodiversity, potentially leading to trophic cascades. Since many Caribbean reefs are more severely degraded than those found around Bonaire, it is to be expected that the findings presented here are rather the rule than the exception, but the study also highlights the need for similar high spatial resolution (along-coast) assessments of budget states and accretion rates to meaningfully explore increasing coastal risk at the country level. The findings also more generally underline the significance of reducing local anthropogenic disturbance and restoring framework building coral assemblages. Appropriately focussed local preservation efforts may aid in averting future large-scale above reef water depth increases on Caribbean coral reefs and will limit the social and economic implications associated with the loss of reef goods and services. © 2019 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown that several bird species can use street lighting to extend activity into the night during the breeding season. However, most of these studies are correlational and little is known about the effects of artificial night lighting on the timing of activities outside the breeding season. During winter, low temperatures and short days may limit foraging opportunities and can negatively affect survival of resident birds. However, night lighting may allow them to expand the time niche available for foraging. Here, we report on a study where we repeatedly manipulated the amount of night lighting during early winter at automated feeding stations in a natural forest. We used video-recordings at the feeders to determine the time of the first (at dawn) and last (at dusk) foraging visits for six songbird species. We predicted that all species, and in particular the naturally early-foraging species, would advance their daily onset of foraging during the mornings with night lighting, but would show minimal or no delays in their daily cessation of foraging during the lighted evenings. We found that two early-foraging species, the blue tit and the great tit, started foraging earlier during the experimentally lighted mornings. However, in great tits, this effect was weak and restricted to nights with inclement weather. The light treatment did not have any effect on the start of foraging in the willow/marsh tit, the nuthatch, the European jay, and the blackbird. Artificial night lighting did not cause later foraging at dusk in any of the six species. Overall, our results suggest that artificial light during winter has only small effects on timing of foraging. We discuss these findings and the importance of temperature and winter weather in shaping the observed foraging patterns. © 2015 The Authors",,Aves; Passeri; Turdus merula; breeding season; diurnal variation; ecological impact; experimental study; foraging efficiency; light effect; light pollution; songbird; survival; winter,,,,,,,"Amrhein V., Wild bird feeding (probably) affects avian urban ecology, Avian urban ecology: behavioural and physiological adaptations, pp. Gil-37, (2014); Bakken L., Bakken G., American redstart feeding by artificial light, Auk, 94, pp. 373-374, (1977); Becker D.J., Streicker D.G., Altizer S., Linking anthropogenic resources to wildlife-pathogen dynamics: a review and meta-analysis, Ecol.

The consequences for ecosystems range from exposure to high light intensities in the vicinity of direct light sources to the very widespread but lower lighting levels further away [2]. While it is known that species exhibit a range of physiological and behavioral responses to artificial nighttime lighting [e.g., 3–5], there is a need to gain a mechanistic understanding of whole ecological community impacts [6, 7], especially to different light intensities. Using a mesocosm field experiment with insect communities, we determined the impact of intensities of artificial light ranging from 0.1 to 100 lux on different trophic levels and interactions between species. Strikingly, we found the strongest impact at low levels of artificial lighting (0.1 to 5 lux), which led to a 1.8 times overall reduction in aphid densities. Mechanistically, artificial light at night increased the efficiency of parasitoid wasps in attacking aphids, with twice the parasitism rate under low light levels compared to unlit controls. However, at higher light levels, parasitoid wasps spent longer away from the aphid host plants, diminishing this increased efficiency. Therefore, aphids reached higher densities under increased light intensity as compared to low levels of lighting, where they were limited by higher parasitoid efficiency. Our study highlights the importance of different intensities of artificial light in driving the strength of species interactions and ecosystem functions. Sanders et al. demonstrate how different intensities of artificial light at night change interactions in experimental insect food webs between aphids and parasitoid wasps as their natural enemies. Major food web parameters such as parasitism rate, aphid abundance, and plant biomass were correlated with light intensity, highlighting that outcomes for ecological communities depend very much on the intensity of this widespread human impact. © 2018 The Authors",aphids; food webs; light pollution; parasitism rate; parasitoids,"Animals; Aphids; Circadian Rhythm; Crops, Agricultural; England; Food Chain; Host-Parasite Interactions; Insecta; Light; Lighting; Wasps; animal; aphid; circadian rhythm; crop; England; food chain; growth, development and aging; host parasite interaction; illumination; insect; light; parasitology; physiology; wasp",,,,,"Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/N001672/1); National Eye Research Centre, NERC","The research leading to this paper was funded from NERC grant NE/N001672/1 .

However, because the spatial resolution of existing land cover datasets is too coarse, large-scale land cover changes in the Arctic–Boreal region (ABR) have been poorly characterized. Here, we use 31 years (1984–2014) of moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite imagery over a region spanning 4.7 × 106 km2 in Alaska and northwestern Canada to characterize regional-scale ABR land cover changes. We find that 13.6 ± 1.3% of the domain has changed, primarily via two major modes of transformation: (a) simultaneous disturbance-driven decreases in Evergreen Forest area (−14.7 ± 3.0% relative to 1984) and increases in Deciduous Forest area (+14.8 ± 5.2%) in the Boreal biome; and (b) climate-driven expansion of Herbaceous and Shrub vegetation (+7.4 ± 2.0%) in the Arctic biome. By using time series of 30 m imagery, we characterize dynamics in forest and shrub cover occurring at relatively short spatial scales (hundreds of meters) due to fires, harvest, and climate-induced growth that are not observable in coarse spatial resolution (e.g., 500 m or greater pixel size) imagery. Wildfires caused most of Evergreen Forest Loss and Evergreen Forest Gain and substantial areas of Deciduous Forest Gain. Extensive shifts in the distribution of plant functional types at multiple spatial scales are consistent with observations of increased atmospheric CO2 seasonality and ecosystem productivity at northern high-latitudes and signal continental-scale shifts in the structure and function of northern high-latitude ecosystems in response to climate change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Arctic; Boreal forest; deciduous forest; evergreen; forest disturbance; land cover change; plant functional type; remote sensing; shrub encroachment; wildfire,Alaska; Arctic Regions; Canada; Climate Change; Ecosystem; North America; Arctic; North America; boreal forest; climate forcing; deciduous forest; evergreen forest; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; Alaska; Arctic; Canada; climate change; ecosystem; North America,,,,,"Eli Melaas; Isla Myers-Smith; National Science Foundation, NSF, (80NSSC18K0994, DGE-1247312, NNX15AU63A, NNX17AE74G); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This study was part of the Arctic–Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE).

The negative ecological consequences of artificial night lighting have been identified in several key life history traits across multiple taxa (albeit with a strong vertebrate focus); comparable data for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we explored the effect of chronic exposure to different night-time lighting intensities on growth, reproduction and survival in Drosophila melanogaster. We reared three generations of flies under identical daytime light conditions (2600 lx) and one of four ecologically relevant ALAN treatments (0, 1, 10 or 100 lx), then explored variation in oviposition, number of eggs produced, juvenile growth and survival and adult survival. We found that, in the presence of light at night (1, 10 and 100 lx treatments), the probability of a female commencing oviposition and the number of eggs laid was significantly reduced. This did not translate into differences at the juvenile phase: juvenile development times and the probability of eclosing as an adult were comparable across all treatments. However, we demonstrate for the first time a direct link between chronic exposure to light at night (greater than 1 lx) and adult survival. Our data highlight that ALAN has the capacity to cause dramatic shifts in multiple life history traits at both the individual and population level. Such shifts are likely to be species-specific, however a more in depth understanding of the broad-scale impact of ALAN and the relevant mechanisms driving biological change is urgently required as we move into an increasing brightly lit future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Development; Drosophila melanogaster; Fecundity; Fitness traits; Light pollution; Longevity,"Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Fertility; Light; Lighting; Longevity; Pupa; Drosophila melanogaster; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; adult; biological development; ecological impact; fecundity; fitness; fly; growth; life history trait; light effect; light pollution; longevity; oviposition; pollution exposure; survival; urban area; animal; Drosophila melanogaster; female; fertility; growth, development and aging; illumination; light; longevity; physiology; pupa; radiation response",,,,,,,"Arendt J., Skene D.J., Melatonin as a chronobiotic, Sleep Med.

Early life experiences are extremely important for the development, physiological status and health of organisms, and as such, early exposure to artificial light may have detrimental consequences for organism fitness. We experimentally manipulated the light environment of free-living great tit nestlings (Parus major), an important model species in evolutionary and environmental research. Haptoglobin (Hp) and nitric oxide (NOx), as important indicators of immunity, health, and physiological condition, were quantified in nestlings at baseline (13 days after hatching) and after a two night exposure to ALAN. We found that ALAN increased Hp and decreased NOx. ALAN may increase stress and oxidative stress and reduce melatonin which could subsequently lead to increased Hp and decreased NOx. Haptoglobin is part of the immune response and mounting an immune response is costly in energy and resources and, trade-offs are likely to occur with other energetically demanding tasks, such as survival or reproduction. Acute inhibition of NOx may have a cascading effect as it also affects other physiological aspects and may negatively affect immunocompetence. The consequences of the observed effects on Hp and NOx remain to be examined. Our study provides experimental field evidence that ALAN affects nestlings’ physiology during development and early life exposure to ALAN could therefore have long lasting effects throughout adulthood. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial light at night; Development; Early-life; Light pollution; Physiology,"Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Haptoglobins; Light; Melatonin; Nesting Behavior; Nitric Oxide; Oxidative Stress; Photoperiod; Reproduction; Songbirds; Animalia; Parus major; Animals; Economic and social effects; Health; Immune system; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; haptoglobin; melatonin; nitric oxide; haptoglobin; melatonin; nitric oxide; Artificial light; Development; Early life; Environmental pressures; Environmental researches; Light pollution; Physiological condition; Physiological status; ecophysiology; experimental study; light pollution; nestling; physiological response; pollution effect; pollution exposure; songbird; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; early life stress; ecophysiology; female; hatching; health status; immune response; immunity; immunocompetence; light exposure; light pollution; male; nestling; night; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Parus major; quantitative analysis; reproduction; songbird; survival; task performance; adverse effects; animal; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; light; metabolism; nesting; photoperiodicity; physiology; pollution; radiation response; songbird; Physiology",,"haptoglobin, 9087-69-8; melatonin, 73-31-4; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Haptoglobins, ; Melatonin, ; Nitric Oxide, ",,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (1.1.044.15N); Universiteit Antwerpen","We thank Raïssa de Boer, David Costantini, Jasmijn Daans, Geert Eens, Sara Raap-van Bussel, Peter Scheys, Manrico Sebastiano, Griet Van Schoote and Anke Vermeulen for their kind assistance.

Yet, the knowledge base needed to identify gaps and priorities for NIS research and management is limited. Here, we reviewed primary introduction events to each ecoregion of the marine Arctic realm to identify temporal and spatial patterns, likely source regions of NIS, and the putative introduction pathways. We included 54 introduction events representing 34 unique NIS. The rate of NIS discovery ranged from zero to four species per year between 1960 and 2015. The Iceland Shelf had the greatest number of introduction events (n = 14), followed by the Barents Sea (n = 11), and the Norwegian Sea (n = 11). Sixteen of the 54 introduction records had no known origins. The majority of those with known source regions were attributed to the Northeast Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, 19 and 14 records, respectively. Some introduction events were attributed to multiple possible pathways. For these introductions, vessels transferred the greatest number of aquatic NIS (39%) to the Arctic, followed by natural spread (30%) and aquaculture activities (25%). Similar trends were found for introductions attributed to a single pathway. The phyla Arthropoda and Ochrophyta had the highest number of recorded introduction events, with 19 and 12 records, respectively. Recommendations including vector management, horizon scanning, early detection, rapid response, and a pan-Arctic biodiversity inventory are considered in this paper. Our study provides a comprehensive record of primary introductions of NIS for marine environments in the circumpolar Arctic and identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities for NIS research and management. Ecosystems worldwide will face dramatic changes in the coming decades due to global change. Our findings contribute to the knowledge base needed to address two aspects of global change—invasive species and climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

The nursery industry is a key business of the tree trade network. Variability in demand for trees makes it difficult for nursery owners to predict how many trees to produce in their nursery. When in any given year, the demand for trees is larger than the production, nursery owners buy trees from foreign sources to match market demand. These imports may introduce exotic diseases. We have developed a model of the dynamics of plant production linked to an economic model. We have used this to quantify the effect of demand variability on the risk of introducing an exotic disease. We find that: (a) When the cost of producing a tree in a UK nursery is considerably smaller than the cost of importing a tree (in the example presented, less than half the importing cost), the risk of introducing an exotic disease is hardly affected by an increase in demand variability. (b) When the cost of producing a tree in the nursery is smaller than, but not very different from the cost of importing a tree, the risk of importing exotic diseases increases with increasing demand variability. Synthesis and applications. Our model and results demonstrate how a balanced management of demand variability and costs can reduce the risk of importing an exotic forest disease according to the management strategy adopted. For example, a management strategy that can reduce the demand variability, the ratio of production to import cost or both, optimizes the nursery gross margin when mainly own-produced trees are commercialized. This can also translate into a reduction of the risk of introducing exotic forest diseases due to the small number of imported trees for sale. © 2018 Rothamsted Research.

Lighting directly affects plants, but few studies have investigated indirect effects mediated by interacting organisms. Nocturnal Lepidoptera are globally important pollinators, and pollen transport by moths is disrupted by lighting. Many street lighting systems are being replaced with novel, energy-efficient lighting, with unknown ecological consequences. Using the wildflower Silene latifolia, we compared pollination success and quality at experimentally lit and unlit plots, testing two major changes to street lighting technology: in lamp type, from high-pressure sodium lamps to light-emitting diodes, and in lighting regime, from full-night (FN) to part-night (PN) lighting. We predicted that lighting would reduce pollination. S. latifolia was pollinated both diurnally and nocturnally. Contrary to our predictions, flowers under FN lighting had higher pollination success than flowers under either PN lighting or unlit controls, which did not significantly differ from each other. Lamp type, lighting regime, and distance from the light all significantly affected aspects of pollination quality. These results confirm that street lighting could affect plant reproduction through indirect effects mediated by nocturnal insects, and further highlight the possibility for novel lighting technologies to mitigate the effects of ALAN on ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors.",artificial light at night; environmental change; flowers; Lepidoptera; light pollution; moths,,,,,,"Butterfly Conservation; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/K007394/1)","This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and Butterfly Conservation (Industrial CASE studentship awarded to C.J.M., Project Reference: NE/K007394/1).

Meanwhile, effects of very low intensities of light pollution on animals have rarely been investigated. We explored the effects of low intensity ALAN over seven months in eight experimental bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations in large grassland enclosures over winter and early breeding season, using LED garden lamps. Initial populations consisted of eight individuals (32 animals per hectare) in enclosures with or without ALAN. We found that bank voles under ALAN experienced changes in daily activity patterns and space use behavior, measured by automated radiotelemetry. There were no differences in survival and body mass, measured with live trapping, and none in levels of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Voles in the ALAN treatment showed higher activity at night during half moon, and had larger day ranges during new moon. Thus, even low levels of light pollution as experienced in remote areas or by sky glow can lead to changes in animal behavior and could have consequences for species interactions. Very low intensities of artificial light at night lead to changes in space use behavior and activity in bank voles in a long-term outdoor experiment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial light; Chronic stress; LED; Light pollution; Myodes glareolus; Survival success,"Animals; Arvicolinae; Behavior, Animal; Breeding; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollution; Light; Seasons; Animalia; Clethrionomys glareolus; Mammalia; Muridae; Light emitting diodes; Mammals; Metabolites; Pollution; drug metabolite; glucocorticoid; Activity spaces; Artificial light; Bank voles; Chronic stress; Dim light; Light pollution; Low-intensity; Myode glareolu; Space use; Survival success; activity pattern; behavioral response; body mass; light effect; light pollution; rodent; space use; survival; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal trapping; Article; automation; body mass; breeding; controlled study; female; light pollution; male; Myodes glareolus; night; nonhuman; space; survival; telemetry; winter; analysis; animal; animal behavior; Arvicolinae; environmental exposure; light; physiology; pollution; season; statistics and numerical data; Enclosures",,,,,,,"Abilio V.C., Freitas F.M., Dolnikoff M.S., Et al., Effects of continuous exposure to light on behavioral dopaminergic supersensitivity, Biol.

As bees exclusively rely on pollen for development and survival, such declines could be partly related to changes in their host plant abundance and quality. Here, we investigate whether generalist bumblebee species, with stable population trends over the past years, adapted their diets in response to changes in the distribution and chemical quality of their pollen resources. We selected five common species of bumblebee in NW Europe for which we had a precise description of their pollen diet through two time periods (‘prior to 1950’ and ‘2004–2005’). For each species, we assessed whether the shift in their pollen diet was related with the changes in the suitable area of their pollen resources. Concurrently, we evaluated whether the chemical composition of pollen resources changed over time and experimentally tested the impact of new major pollen species on the development of B. terrestris microcolonies. Only one species (i.e. B. lapidarius) significantly included more pollen from resources whose suitable area expanded. This opportunist pattern could partly explain the expansion of B. lapidarius in Europe. Regarding the temporal variation in the chemical composition of the pollen diet, total and essential amino acid contents did not differ significantly between the two time periods while we found significant differences among plant species. This result is driven by the great diversity of resources used by bumblebee species in both periods. Our bioassay revealed that the shift to new major pollen resources allowed microcolonies to develop, bringing new evidence on the opportunist feature of bumblebee in their diets. Overall, this study shows that the response to pollen resource drift varies among closely related pollinators, and a species-rich plant community ensures generalist species to select a nutrient-rich pollen diet. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",bumblebee; diet performance; floral resources; food choices; land-use change; pollen,Animals; Bees; Diet; Europe; Feeding Behavior; Plants; Pollen; Europe; Apoidea; bee; bioassay; diet; food preference; generalist; host plant; land use change; plant community; pollen; pollinator; population decline; animal; bee; diet; Europe; feeding behavior; plant; pollen,,,,,,,"Aguirre-Gutierrez J., Carvalheiro L.G., Polce C., Van Loon E.E., Raes N., Reemer M., Fit-for-purpose: species distribution model performance depends on evaluation criteria - Dutch hoverflies as a case study, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Beekman M., Van Stratum P., Lingeman R., Diapause survival and post-diapause performance in bumblebee queens (Bombus terrestris), Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 89, pp. 207-214, (1998); Behmer S.T., Nes W.D., Insect sterol nutrition and physiology: a global overview, Advances in Insect Physiology, 31, pp. 1-72, (2003); Bommarco R., Lundin O., Smith H.G., Rundlof M., Drastic historic shifts in bumble-bee community composition in Sweden, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 272, pp. 309-315, (2011); Chittka L., Schurkens S., Metrology: successful invasion of a floral market, Nature, 411, (2001); Cnaani J., Hefetz A., The effect of workers size frequency distribution on colony development in Bombus terrestris, Insectes Sociaux, 41, pp. 301-307, (1994); Day S., Beyer R., Mercer A., Ogden S., The nutrient composition of honeybee-collected pollen in Otago, New Zealand, Journal of Apicultural Research, 29, pp. 138-146, (1990); De Groot A.P., Protein and amino acid requirements of the Honey bee (Apis mellifera), Physiologia Comparata et d'Ecologia, 3, pp. 197-285, (1953); Dormann C.F., Elith J., Bacher S., Collinearity: a review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance, Ecography, 36, pp. 27-46, (2013); Eckhardt M., Haider M., Dorn S., Muller A., Ings T., Pollen mixing in pollen generalist solitary bees: a possible strategy to complement or mitigate unfavourable pollen properties?, Journal of Animal Ecology, 83, (2014); Ellers J., Fat and eggs: an alternative method to measure the trade-off between survival and reproduction in insect parasitoids, Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 46, pp. 227-235, (1996); Fuchs R., Herold M., Verburg P.H., Clevers J.G.P.W., Eberle J., Gross changes in reconstructions of historic land cover/use for Europe between 1900 and 2010, Global Change Biology, 21, pp. 299-313, (2015); Goulson D., Darvill B., Niche overlap and diet breadth in bumblebees; are rare species more specialized in their choice of flowers?, Apidologie, 35, pp. 55-63, (2004); Goulson D., Nicholls E., Botias C., Rotheray E.L., Bee declines driven by combined stress from parasites, pesticides and lack of flowers, Science, 347, pp. 1436-1444, (2015); Hamann A., Wang T., Spittlehouse D.L., Murdock T.Q., A comprehensive, high-resolution database of historical and projected climate surfaces for western North America, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 94, pp. 1307-1309, (2013); Hanley J.A., McNeil B.J., The meaning and use of the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Radiology, 143, pp. 29-36, (1982); Hanley M.E., Franco M., Pichon S., Darvill B., Goulson D., Breeding system, pollinator choice and variation in pollen quality in British herbaceous plants, Functional Ecology, 22, pp. 592-598, (2008); Harmon-Threatt A.N., Kremen C., Bumble bees selectively use native and exotic species to maintain nutritional intake across highly variable and invaded local floral resource pools, Ecological Entomology, 40, pp. 471-478, (2015); Hijmans R.J., Cameron S.E., Parra J.L., Jones P.G., Jarvis A., Very high resolution interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas, International Journal of Climatology, 25, pp. 1965-1978, (2005); Hugel M.F., Étude de quelques constituants du pollen, Annales des Abeilles, 5, pp. 97-133, (1962); Inoue M.N., Yokoyama J., Washitani I., Displacement of Japanese native bumblebees by the recently introduced Bombus terrestris (L.)

However, examples of disruptions of species interactions through changes in light remain rare and how artificial night light may alter predator-prey relationships are particularly understudied. In this study, we examined whether artificial night light could impact prey attraction and interception in Nephila pilipes orb weaver spiders, conspicuous predators who make use of yellow color patterns to mimic floral resources and attract prey to their webs. We measured moth prey attraction and interception responses to treatments where we experimentally manipulated the color/contrast of spider individuals in the field (removed yellow markings) and also set up light manipulations. We found that lit webs had lower rates of moth interception than unlit webs. Spider color, however, had no clear impact on moth interception or attraction rates in lit nor unlit webs. The results show that night light can reduce prey interception for spiders. Additionally, this study highlights how environmental and morphological variation can complicate simple predictions of ecological light pollution's disruption of species interactions. © 2017 Yuen and Bonebrake.",Arachnology;

Intertidal species exhibit many night-time-dependent ecological strategies, including feeding, reproduction, orientation and predator avoidance, which are likely negatively affected by shifting light regimes, as has been observed in terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Coastal lighting may shape intertidal communities through its influence on the nocturnal foraging activity of dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus), a widespread predatory mollusc that structures biodiversity in temperate rocky shores. In the laboratory, we investigated whether the basal and foraging activity of this predator was affected by exposure to night-time lighting both in the presence and absence of olfactory predator cues (Carcinus maenas, common shore crab). Assessments of dogwhelks’ behavioural responses to night-time white LED lighting were performed on individuals that had been acclimated to night-time white LED lighting conditions for 16 days and individuals that had not previously been exposed to artificial light at night. Dogwhelks acclimated to night-time lighting exhibited natural refuge-seeking behaviour less often compared to control animals, but were more likely to respond to and handle prey irrespective of whether olfactory predator cues were present. These responses suggest night-time lighting likely increased the energetic demand of dogwhelks through stress, encouraging foraging whenever food was available, regardless of potential danger. Contrastingly, whelks not acclimated under night-time lighting were more likely to respond to the presence of prey under artificial light at night when olfactory predator cues were present, indicating an opportunistic shift towards the use of visual instead of olfactory cues in risk evaluation. These results demonstrate that artificial night-time lighting influences the behaviour of intertidal fauna such that the balance of interspecific interactions involved in community structuring may be affected. © 2017 The Authors.

Artificial night lighting is often considered as driving force behind rapid moth population declines in severely illuminated countries. To understand these declines, the question remains whether artificial light causes only increased mortality or also sublethal effects. We show that moths subjected to artificial night lighting spend less time feeding than moths in darkness, with the shortest time under light conditions rich in short wavelength radiation. These findings provide evidence for sublethal effects contributing to moth population declines. Because effects are strong under various types of light compared with dark conditions, the potential of spectral alterations as a conservation tool may be overestimated. Therefore, restoration and maintenance of darkness in illuminated areas is essential for reversing declines of moth populations. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Nighttime lighting has direct biological impacts on species at all trophic levels. However, the effects of artificial light on biotic interactions remain, for the most part, to be determined. We exposed experimental mesocosms containing combinations of grassland plants and invertebrate herbivores and predators to illumination at night over a 3-year period to simulate conditions under different common forms of street lighting. We demonstrate both top-down (predation-controlled) and bottom-up (resource-controlled) impacts of artificial light at night in grassland communities. The impacts on invertebrate herbivore abundance were wavelength-dependent and mediated via other trophic levels. White LED lighting decreased the abundance of a generalist herbivore mollusc by 55% in the presence of a visual predator, but not in its absence, while monochromatic amber light (with a peak wavelength similar to low-pressure sodium lighting) decreased abundance of a specialist herbivore aphid (by 17%) by reducing the cover and flower abundance of its main food plant in the system. Artificial white light also significantly increased the food plant's foliar carbon to nitrogen ratio. We conclude that exposure to artificial light at night can trigger ecological effects spanning trophic levels, and that the nature of such impacts depends on the wavelengths emitted by the lighting technology employed. Policy implications. Our results confirm that artificial light at night, at illuminance levels similar to roadside vegetation, can have population effects mediated by both top-down and bottom-up effects on ecosystems. Given the increasing ubiquity of light pollution at night, these impacts may be widespread in the environment. These results underline the importance of minimizing ecosystem disruption by reducing light pollution in natural and seminatural ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors.

Nocturnal dim light could modify fish behaviour and benefit visual predators because of enhanced foraging success compared to dark nights. However, effects of nocturnal light could be mitigated by the presence of structured habitats providing refuges for prey. We tested in laboratory experiments whether nocturnal light of low intensity (2 lx) increases foraging efficiency of the Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) on invertebrate prey (Gammarus fossarum). The tests were conducted at dusk and night under two light regimes: natural cycle with dark nights and disturbed cycle with artificially illuminated nights, in habitats differing in structural complexity: sand and woody debris. We found that nocturnal illumination significantly enhanced the consumption of gammarids by fish compared to dark nights. In addition, the perch was as effective predator in illuminated nights (2 lx) as at dusk (10 lx). Woody debris provided an effective refuge only in combination with undisturbed darkness, but not in illuminated nights. Our results suggest that nocturnal illumination in aquatic ecosystems may contribute to significant reductions in invertebrate population sizes through fish predation. The loss of darkness reduces the possibility of using shelters by invertebrates and hence the effects of elevated light levels at night could not be mitigated by an increased habitat complexity. © 2019",Artificial light at night; Fish; Invertebrates; Predation; Urban ecosystems,Amphipoda; Animals; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Light; Perches; Predatory Behavior; Gammaridae; Gammarus fossarum; Invertebrata; Perca fluviatilis; Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Debris; Population statistics; Artificial light; Freshwater ecosystem; Habitat complexity; In-laboratory experiments; Invertebrates; Predation; Structural complexity; Urban ecosystem; amphipod; complexity; foraging behavior; habitat structure; light effect; percid; predation; urban ecosystem; aquatic environment; article; darkness; foraging; Gammarus fossarum; habitat; illumination; night; nonhuman; Perca fluviatilis; population size; predator; Amphipoda; animal; ecosystem; food chain; light; perch; physiology; predation; radiation response; Fish,,,,,,,"Alabaster J.S., Stott B., Swimming activity of perch, Perca fluviatilis L, J.

One potential for considerable mismatch is between migratory birds and food availability in northern breeding ranges, and these mismatches may have consequences for ecosystem function. We conducted a three-year experiment to examine the consequences for CO2 exchange of advanced spring green-up and altered timing of grazing by migratory Pacific black brant in a coastal wetland in western Alaska. Experimental treatments represent the variation in green-up and timing of peak grazing intensity that currently exists in the system. Delayed grazing resulted in greater net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP), while early grazing reduced CO2 uptake with the potential of causing net ecosystem carbon (C) loss in late spring and early summer. Conversely, advancing the growing season only influenced ecosystem respiration (ER), resulting in a small increase in ER with no concomitant impact on GPP or NEE. The experimental treatment that represents the most likely future, with green-up advancing more rapidly than arrival of migratory geese, results in NEE changing by 1.2 µmol m−2 s−1 toward a greater CO2 sink in spring and summer. Increased sink strength, however, may be mitigated by early arrival of migratory geese, which would reduce CO2 uptake. Importantly, while the direct effect of climate warming on phenology of green-up has a minimal influence on NEE, the indirect effect of climate warming manifest through changes in the timing of peak grazing can have a significant impact on C balance in northern coastal wetlands. Furthermore, processes influencing the timing of goose migration in the winter range can significantly influence ecosystem function in summer habitats. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Arctic; ecosystem respiration; greenhouse gas emission; herbivory; net ecosystem exchange; Pacific black brant; phenological mismatch; subarctic,Alaska; Animal Migration; Animals; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Geese; Herbivory; Seasons; Alaska; United States; Anser; Aves; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; herbivory; migratory species; net ecosystem exchange; phenology; respiration; waterfowl; Alaska; animal; carbon cycle; climate change; goose; herbivory; metabolism; physiology; population migration; season,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ",,,"U.S. Government; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1304523); Division of Graduate Education, DGE, (DGE1633756); Division of Arctic Sciences, ARC, (ARC1304523, ARC1304879); U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USFWS, (FF07RYKD00-14-06, MB28352B-0); Alaska Department of Fish and Game, ADF&G, (16-023)","Funding text 1: Division of Arctic Sciences, Grant/Award Number: ARC1304523, ARC1304879; Division of Graduate Education, Grant/ Award Number: DGE1633756; National Science Foundation; Funding text 2: We thank R.

Studies from temperate regions suggest that, among aerial insectivorous bats, fast-flying species that forage in the open are attracted to artificial lights, whereas slow-flying species that forage in cluttered environments avoid those lights. We measured aerial insectivore responses to light pollution in a tropical cloud forest to test this hypothesis. Bat echolocation was recorded at 20 pairs of light and dark sites in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Foraging activity was higher at artificially lighted sites than dark sites near the new moon, especially around blue-white fluorescent lighting. Most recorded bat species showed increased or unchanged activity in response to light, including some slow-flying and edge-foraging bats. This finding suggests that, contrary to the evaluated hypothesis, flight speed and foraging mode are not sufficient to determine bat responses to artificial lights in the tropics. Two bat species showed decreased activity at light sites, and a low species evenness was recorded around lights, particularly fluorescent lights, compared with dark sites. As in the temperate zone, light pollution in the tropics seems to concentrate certain bat species around human-inhabited areas, potentially shifting community structure. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",Chiroptera;

We investigated the combined effects of night-time warming and light pollution on pea aphids and two predatory ladybeetle species. As expected, neither night-time warming nor light pollution changed the suppression of aphids by the ladybeetle species that forages effectively in darkness. However, for the more-visual predator, warming and light had non-additive effects in which together they caused much lower aphid abundances. These results are particularly relevant for agriculture near urban areas that experience both light pollution and warming from urban heat islands. Because warming and light pollution can have non-additive effects, predicting their possible combined consequences over broad spatial scales requires knowing how they co-occur. We found that night-time temperature change since 1949 covaried positively with light pollution, which has the potential to increase their non-additive effects on pea aphid control by 70% in US alfalfa. Our results highlight the importance of non-additive effects of multiple environmental factors on species and food webs, especially when these factors co-occur. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, which is known to disrupt bird, sea turtle, and bat behavior, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. On a weekly basis, sections of the structure were subjected to different light treatments including no light added, followed by a Reference period when lights were off in all the structure sections. Sand track data revealed use by 23 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, nine of which had >. 30 tracks for species-level analysis. Columbia black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) traversed under unlit bridge sections much less when neighboring sections were lit compared to when none were, suggesting avoidance due to any nearby presence of artificial light. Similarly, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) track paths were less frequent in the lit sections than the ambient. Crossing was correlated with temporal or spatial factors but not light for three of the other species. These findings suggest that artificial light may be reducing habitat connectivity for some species though not providing a strong barrier for others. Such information is needed to inform mitigation of habitat fragmentation in the face of expanding urbanization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial light; Experimental lighting; Habitat connectivity; Light pollution; Wildlife crossing structures,Amphibia; Animalia; Aves; Cheloniidae; Didelphidae; Didelphis virginiana; Mammalia; Odocoileus hemionus columbianus; Peromyscus maniculatus; Reptilia; Vertebrata; activity pattern; amphibian; anthropogenic effect; bird; connectivity; experimental study; habitat fragmentation; light pollution; mammal; reptile; spatial distribution; tracking; wild population,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (0948041)","LLBK and BCT were supported by NSF award  0948041 .

However, because C and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles are closely coupled, straw return may also affect soil reactive N (Nr) losses, but these effects remain uncertain, especially in terms of the interactions between soil C sequestration and Nr losses under straw addition. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis using 363 publications to assess the overall effects of straw return on soil Nr losses, C sequestration and crop productivity in agroecosystems. Our results show that on average, compared to mineral N fertilization, straw return with same amount of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased soil organic C (SOC) content (14.9%), crop yield (5.1%), and crop N uptake (10.9%). Moreover, Nr losses in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies (17.3%), N leaching (8.7%), and runoff (25.6%) were significantly reduced, mainly due to enhanced microbial N immobilization. However, N2O emissions from upland fields (21.5%) and ammonia (NH3) emissions (17.0%) significantly increased following straw return, mainly due to the stimulation of nitrification/denitrification and soil urease activity. The increase in NH3 and N2O emissions was significantly and negatively correlated with straw C/N ratio and soil clay content. Regarding the interactions between C sequestration and Nr losses, the increase in SOC content following straw return was significantly and positively correlated with the decrease in N leaching and runoff. However, at a global scale, straw return increased net Nr losses from both rice and upland fields due to a greater stimulation of NH3 emissions than the reduction in N leaching and runoff. The trade-offs between increased net Nr losses and soil C sequestration highlight the importance of reasonably managing straw return to soils to limit NH3 emissions without decreasing associated C sequestration potential. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ammonia emission; carbon sequestration; crop productivity; reactive N losses; straw return; trade-off relationship,Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Fertilizers; Humic Substances; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural ecosystem; ammonia; carbon sequestration; crop production; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; humic substance; meta analysis; metabolism; nitrification; Oryza; procedures; soil,,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Fertilizers, ; Humic Substances, ; Nitrogen, ; Nitrous Oxide, ; Soil, ",,,"IMK-IFU; Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research; Office of the China Postdoctoral Council of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security; University of Aberdeen, UK); Ziyin Shang; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41425005)","This study was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41425005) and the “China and Germany Postdoctoral Exchange Program” jointly funded by the Office of the China Postdoctoral Council of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK-IFU), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

This study examined the effects of ecologically relevant levels of ALAN on three key measures of immune function (haemocyte concentration, lytic activity, and phenoloxidase activity) using a model invertebrate species, the Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. We reared crickets under an ecologically relevant daily light-cycle consisting of 12 hr bright daylight (2600 lx) followed by either 12 h darkness (0 lx) or dim environmentally relevant ALAN (1, 10, 100 lx), and then assessed immune function at multiple time points throughout adult life using haemolymph samples. We found that the presence of ALAN had a clear negative effect on haemocytes, while the effects on lytic activity and phenoloxidase activity were more complex or largely unaffected by ALAN. Furthermore, the effects of lifelong exposure to ALAN of 1 lx were comparable to those of 10 and 100 lx. Our data suggest that the effects of ALAN could be large and widespread, and such reductions in the core immune response of individuals will likely have greater consequences for fitness and survival under more malign conditions, such as those of the natural environment. © 2019 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",circadian rhythm; ecophysiology; immune function; immunomodulation; invertebrate; light pollution; melatonin; urbanization,"Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Gryllidae; Immunity, Cellular; Light; Male; Photoperiod; adverse event; animal; cellular immunity; circadian rhythm; female; Gryllidae; light; male; photoperiodicity; physiology",,,,,"Robert Johanson and Anne Swann Fund; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP150101191); Hermon Slade Foundation, (HSF 14/4)","Contributions are as follows: JD participated in the experimental design and undertook the data collection, data analysis, and manuscript preparation; MPG participated in experimental design, data analysis and manuscript preparation; TMJ conceived the study and participated in experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.

Decades-long advancement in crop breeding has progressively elevated yield potential, markedly enhancing global food production capacity. However, relevant impact on reactive N (Nr) emissions associated with crop variety improvement has not been explicitly described. Here, we report multitiered evidence that newer and select maize, wheat, and rice varieties developed in China have the capacity to substantially lower Nr losses while producing more grain. First, we pooled studies featuring side-by-side comparison of different varieties, totaling 269 paired observations, to demonstrate that collectively, relatively newer varieties of maize, wheat, and rice had less Nr emissions (9.6%–23.5%) while yielding more grains (7.3%–11.2%) compared to older varieties under wide-ranging conditions. Next, we built an extended database (142 field studies with 833 observations) and comprehensively evaluated the Nr-loss reduction potential of newer varieties (2000 and after) versus older ones (1985–1999). We found that newer varieties had Nr emission factors (N loss as a percentage of N applied after correcting for background emissions) 18.2%–75.7% less for N2O, 18.3%–75.7% less for NO− 3, and −8.5% to 22.8% less for NH3, while producing more grains (16.0%–24.4%). Individual varieties differed markedly in yield-emission scores. A nationwide farmer survey (2.47 million responses) indicated tremendous opportunities for a new way of management intervention. Coupling variety selection with sound N and other agronomic management can help lower N footprint while producing more grain. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",agronomic and morphological traits; grain yield; newer varieties; reactive N losses; sustainability,China; Nitrogen; Oryza; Triticum; Zea mays; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; nitrogen; agronomy; crop yield; database; maize; morphology; nitrogen; rice; sustainability; wheat; China; maize; Oryza; wheat,,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, ",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund, (2019TC222); Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province, (TS201712082); National Outstanding Youth Foundation of China, (31522050); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFD0200105)","The authors acknowledge all those who provided local assistance or technical services involving the farmer survey.

Because ALAN stressful effects are little studied in diurnal amphibian species, we investigated if chronic ALAN exposure affects the leukocyte profile, body condition, and blood cell sizes of a diurnal toad. We hand-captured male toads of Melanophryniscus rubriventris in Angosto de Jaire (Jujuy, Argentina). We prepared blood smears from three groups of toads: “field” (toads processed in the field immediately after capture), “natural light” (toads kept in the laboratory under captivity with natural photoperiod), and “constant light” (toads kept in the laboratory under captivity with constant photoperiod/ALAN). We significantly observed higher neutrophil proportions and neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio in toads under constant light treatment. In addition, we observed significantly better body condition and higher erythrocyte size in field toads compared with captive toads. In summary, ALAN can trigger a leukocyte response to stress in males of the diurnal toad M. rubriventris. In addition, captivity can affect the body condition and erythrocyte size of these toads. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",amphibians; blood cells; captivity; light pollution; stress,Animals; Body Composition; Bufonidae; Cell Size; Erythrocytes; Light; Male; animal; body composition; Bufonidae; cell size; cytology; erythrocyte; light; male; physiology; radiation response,,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET, (PIO‐Conicet 14020140100094CO, Secter-UNJu 084)","The authors would like to especially thank Dr. Liliana Lupo and her lab members (INECOA, UNJu, CONICET) for having allowed us access to the Leica microscope.

Anthropogenic drivers linked to this decline include habitat changes, intensive agriculture, pesticides, invasive alien species, spread of pathogens and climate change. Recently, the rapid global increase in artificial light at night has been proposed to be a new threat to terrestrial ecosystems; the consequences of this increase for ecosystem function are mostly unknown. Here we show that artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks and has negative consequences for plant reproductive success. In artificially illuminated plant-pollinator communities, nocturnal visits to plants were reduced by 62% compared to dark areas. Notably, this resulted in an overall 13% reduction in fruit set of a focal plant even though the plant also received numerous visits by diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, by merging diurnal and nocturnal pollination sub-networks, we show that the structure of these combined networks tends to facilitate the spread of the negative consequences of disrupted nocturnal pollination to daytime pollinator communities. Our findings demonstrate that artificial light at night is a threat to pollination and that the negative effects of artificial light at night on nocturnal pollination are predicted to propagate to the diurnal community, thereby aggravating the decline of the diurnal community. We provide perspectives on the functioning of plant-pollinator communities, showing that nocturnal pollinators are not redundant to diurnal communities and increasing our understanding of the human-induced decline in pollinators and their ecosystem service. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

In this experimental study, which took place on a beach located on the island of Boa Vista (Cabo Verde), three types of artificial light were tested on nesting loggerhead sea turtles as well as on ghost crabs, which intensively predate on nests and hatchlings, to determine the effects they would produce on the behavior of both species. Over the course of 36 days, female loggerheads and ghost crabs were studied under yellow, orange and red lights, with observations also being made on dark nights that served as a control treatment. During this period, the frequencies of nesting attempts, the time taken by turtles to complete each phase of the nesting process, and ghost crab abundance and behaviors were carefully recorded. 1146 loggerhead nesting attempts were observed and recorded during the experiments, and results showed a decrease in nesting attempts of at least 20% when artificial lighting was present. A significant decline in successful attempts was also observed within the central sections of the beach, which corresponded to those that received more light. This artificial lighting significantly increased the time that turtles spent on the nesting process and forced them to do more extensive beach crawls. Despite this, the presence of light had no apparent effect on the final selection of the nesting site. Yellow and orange lights significantly disrupted the sea finding behavior and turtles were often unable to orient themselves seaward under these color lights. Disoriented turtles were observed crawling in circuitous paths in front of the light source for several minutes. In addition, artificial lights had the potential to increase the number of ghost crabs present within the illuminated stretches of the beach. However, only yellow lighting produced a significant change on aggressive and prey searching behaviors. These changes in abundance and behavior could cause a greater predation on loggerhead turtle nests. Red light had no significant impact on the behavior of either species. It should be a priority to enforce preventive measures and light mitigation strategies to ensure the conservation of important loggerhead rookeries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial lighting; Caretta caretta; Nesting behavior; Ocypode cursor; Predation; Sea turtles,Animals; Brachyura; Ecosystem; Light; Nesting Behavior; Predatory Behavior; Risk; Turtles; Article; association; comparative study; controlled study; crab; darkness; egg laying; hatchling; illumination; light; light intensity; light pollution; natural resource; nest predation; nesting; nonhuman; orange light; predation risk; priority journal; red light; sea turtle; seashore; vegetation; yellow light; adverse effects; animal; Brachyura; ecosystem; nesting; predation; radiation response; risk; turtle,,,,,,,"Kyba C.C.M., Ruhtz T., Fischer J., Holker F., Cloud coverage acts as an amplifier for ecological light pollution in urban ecosystems, PLoS One, 6, 3, (2011); Davenport J., Temperature and the life-history strategies of sea turtles, J.

Effects are reported for many species groups, and include changes in presence, behaviour, physiology and life-history traits. Among these, bats are strongly affected, and how bat species react to light is likely to vary with light colour. Different spectra may therefore be applied to reduce negative impacts. We used a unique set-up of eight field sites to study the response of bats to three different experimental light spectra in an otherwise dark and undisturbed natural habitat. We measured activity of three bat species groups around transects with light posts emitting white, green and red light with an intensity commonly used to illuminate countryside roads. The results reveal a strong and spectrum-dependent response for the slowflying Myotis and Plecotus and more agile Pipistrellus species, but not for Nyctalus and Eptesicus species. Plecotus and Myotis species avoided white and green light, but were equally abundant in red light and darkness. The agile, opportunistically feeding Pipistrellus species were significantly more abundant around white and green light, most likely because of accumulation of insects, but equally abundant in red illuminated transects compared to dark control. Forest-dwelling Myotis and Plecotus species and more synanthropic Pipistrellus species are thus least disturbed by red light. Hence, in order to limit the negative impact of light at night on bats, white and green light should be avoided in or close to natural habitat, but red lights may be used if illumination is needed. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Artificial light at night (ALAN) is suspected to interfere with these rhythms. In this study we examined the influence of ALAN on nocturnal melatonin and sex steroid blood concentrations and mRNA expression of gonadotropins in the pituitary of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). In a rural experimental setting, fish were held in net cages in drainage channels experiencing either additional ALAN of ~15 lx at the water surface or natural light conditions at half-moon. No differences in melatonin concentrations between ALAN and natural conditions were detected. However, blood concentration of sex steroids (17β-estradiol; 11-ketotestosterone) as well as mRNA expression of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone) was reduced in both fish species. We conclude that ALAN can disturb biological rhythms in fish in urban waters. However, impacts on melatonin rhythm might have been blurred by individual differences, sampling methods and moonlight. The effect of ALAN on biomarkers of reproduction suggests a photo-labile period around the onset of gonadogenesis, including the experimental period (August).

This includes impacts on ecosystem functioning that can involve feedbacks on climate through changes in rates of greenhouse gas emissions. The combination of high nutrient supply and shallow depth typical of urban freshwaters is particularly conducive to high rates of methane (CH4) production and emission, suggesting a potentially important role in the global CH4 cycle. However, there is a lack of comprehensive flux data from diverse urban water bodies, of information on the underlying drivers, and of estimates for whole cities. Based on measurements over four seasons in a total of 32 water bodies in the city of Berlin, Germany, we calculate the total CH4 emission from various types of surface waters of a large city in temperate climate at 2.6 ± 1.7 Gg CH4/year. The average total emission was 219 ± 490 mg CH4 m−2 day−1. Water chemical variables were surprisingly poor predictors of total CH4 emissions, and proxies of productivity and oxygen conditions had low explanatory power as well, suggesting a complex combination of factors governing CH4 fluxes from urban surface waters. However, small water bodies (area <1 ha) typically located in urban green spaces were identified as emission hotspots. These results help constrain assessments of CH4 emissions from freshwaters in the world's growing cities, facilitating extrapolation of urban emissions to large areas, including at the global scale. © 2019 The Authors.

Artificial light impacts the behaviour of insectivorous bats in numerous ways, including foraging behaviour, which may in turn lead to altered prey selection. In a manipulative field experiment, we collected faecal samples from six species of insectivorous bats in naturally dark and artificially lit conditions, and identified prey items using molecular methods to investigate effects of light pollution on prey selection. Proportional differences in identified prey were not consistent and appeared to be species specific. Red bats, little brown bats and grey bats exhibited expected increases in moths at lit sites. Beetle-specialist big brown bats had a sizeable increase in beetle consumption around lights, while tri-coloured bats and evening bats showed little change in moth consumption between experimental conditions. Dietary overlap was high between experimental conditions within each species, and dietary breadth only changed significantly between experimental conditions in one species, the little brown bat. Policy implications. Our results, building on others, demonstrate that bat–insect interactions may be more nuanced than the common assertion that moth consumption increases around lights. They highlight the need for a greater mechanistic understanding of bat–light interactions to predict which species will be most affected by light pollution. Given differences in bat and insect communities, we advocate biologists, land stewards and civil planners work collaboratively to determine lighting solutions that minimize changes in foraging behaviour of species in the local bat community. Such efforts may allow stakeholders to more effectively craft management strategies to minimize unnatural shifts in prey selection caused by artificial lights. © 2017 The Authors.

Snowmelt timing is advancing rapidly in these ecosystems, but there is still a need to isolate the effects of earlier snowmelt on soil GHG fluxes. For an improved mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical effects of snowmelt timing during the snow-free period, we manipulated a high-elevation forest that typically receives over two meters of snowfall but little summer precipitation to influence legacy effects of snowmelt timing. We altered snowmelt rates for two years using black sand to accelerate snowmelt and white fabric to postpone snowmelt, thus creating a two- to three-week disparity in snowmelt timing. Soil microclimate and fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were monitored weekly to monthly during the snow-free period. Microbial abundances were estimated by potential assays near the end of each snow-free period. Although earlier snowmelt caused soil drying, we found no statistically significant effects (p < 0.05) of altered snowmelt timing on fluxes of CO2 or N2O, or soil microbial abundances. Soil CH4 fluxes, however, did respond to snowmelt timing, with 18% lower rates of CH4 uptake in the earlier snowmelt treatment, but only after a dry winter. Cumulative CO2 emission and CH4 uptake were 43% and 88% greater, respectively, after the dry winter. We conclude that soil GHG fluxes can be surprisingly resistant to hydrological changes associated with earlier snowmelt, likely because of persistent moisture and microbial activities in deeper mineral soils. As a result, a drier California in the future may cause seasonally snow-covered soils in the Sierra Nevada to emit more GHGs, not less. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",methane oxidation; nitrous oxide; snow manipulation; soil respiration; Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory,California; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons; Snow; Soil; California; United States; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; snow; dry forest; greenhouse gas; methane; montane forest; nitrous oxide; oxidation; snowmelt; soil emission; soil microorganism; soil respiration; California; chemistry; ecosystem; forest; greenhouse gas; season; soil,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon Dioxide, ; Greenhouse Gases, ; Methane, ; Nitrous Oxide, ; Soil, ",,,"Kearney Foundation of Soil Science, (Kearney-2009.023); National Science Foundation, NSF; UK-China Critical Zone Observatory, CZO, (1239521, 1331939, EAR-0725097)","We thank Dale Johnson and Anne Kelly for discussions about snowmelt treatment design.

Evidence of its effects on animal physiology and behaviour is accumulating. However, in order to effectively mitigate light pollution it is important to determine which factors contribute to the severity of effects of ALAN. In this experimental study we explored whether there are seasonal-dependent effects of ALAN on sleep in free-living great tits (Parus major), an important model species. Additionally, we looked at whether light intensity determined the severity of effects of ALAN on sleep. We therefore exposed animals to artificial light inside the nest box (3 lx) in December (winter) and February (pre-breeding season). Results from February were compared with the results from a previous study in February, using a lower light intensity (1.6 lx). We found little evidence for a season-dependent response. Effects of ALAN hardly differed between high and low light intensity. ALAN disrupted sleep with as main effect a decrease in sleep duration (≈–40 min) as animals woke up earlier (≈–24 min). However, compared to a natural dark situation sleep onset was delayed by high but not by low light intensity of ALAN. Our study underlines earlier found disruptive effects of ALAN on sleep of free-living animals. While we found no conclusive evidence for seasonal or light intensity-dependent effects of ALAN, additional experimental work using lower light intensities might show such differences. Examining potential management options is crucial in mitigating disruptive effects of light pollution, which will be an important focus for future studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dose-dependent; Mitigation; Season; Urbanization; Wildlife,"Animals; Animals, Wild; Light; Passeriformes; Seasons; Sleep; Animalia; Aves; Parus major; dose-response relationship; experimental study; light intensity; light pollution; mitigation; nest box; seasonal variation; sleep; urbanization; wildfire; animal experiment; breeding; experimental study; light intensity; light pollution; night; nonhuman; Parus major; sleep time; urbanization; wildlife; winter; animal; light; Passeriformes; physiology; season; sleep; wild animal",,,,,"FWO-project; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (1.1.044.15N, 1.1.044.17N); Universiteit Antwerpen","This work was made possible through financial support from the University of Antwerp (to TR, RP, and ME), the FWO Flanders through a PhD fellowship (to TR, grant ID: 1.1.044.15N , 1.1.044.17N ), and a FWO-project (to RP and ME, project ID: G.0A36.15N , G.0521.17N ).

Light at night can have strong effects on the behaviour and physiology of species, which includes changes in the daily timing of activity; a clear example is the advance in dawn song onset in songbirds by low levels of light at night. Although such effects are often referred to as changes in circadian timing, i.e. changes to the internal clock, two alternative mechanisms are possible. First, light at night can change the timing of clock controlled activity, without any change to the clock itself; e.g. by a change in the phase relation between the circadian clock and expression of activity. Second, changes in daily activity can be a direct response to light (‘masking’), without any involvement of the circadian system. Here, we studied whether the advance in onset of activity by dim light at night in great tits (Parus major) is indeed attributable to a phase shift of the internal clock.We entrained birds to a normal light/dark (LD) cycle with bright light during daytime and darkness at night, and to a comparable (LDim) schedule with dim light at night. The dim light at night strongly advanced the onset of activity of the birds. After at least six days in LD or LDim,we kept birds in constant darkness (DD) by leaving off all lights so birds would revert to their endogenous, circadian system controlled timing of activity.We found that the timing of onset in DD was not dependent on whether the birds were kept at LD or LDim before the measurement. Thus, the advance of activity under light at night is caused by a direct effect of light rather than a phase shift of the internal clock. This demonstrates that birds are capable of changing their daily activity to low levels of light at night directly, without the need to alter their internal clock. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.",Artificial light at night; Circadian period; Circadian phase; Entrainment; Light pollution,"Activity Cycles; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Light; Lighting; Linear Models; Male; Photoperiod; Songbirds; Aves; Parus major; animal; animal behavior; circadian rhythm; darkness; illumination; light; male; periodicity; photoperiodicity; physiology; songbird; statistical model",,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen, STW","This research is supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation STW, which is part of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), and which is partly funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Nonetheless, there is growing consensus that global marine primary production will decline in response to future climate change, largely due to increased stratification reducing the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean. Evidence to date suggests a potential amplification of this response throughout the trophic food web, with more dramatic responses at higher trophic levels. Here we show that trophic amplification of marine biomass declines is a consistent feature of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models, across different scenarios of future climate change. Under the business-as-usual Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) global mean phytoplankton biomass is projected to decline by 6.1% ± 2.5% over the twenty-first century, while zooplankton biomass declines by 13.6% ± 3.0%. All models project greater relative declines in zooplankton than phytoplankton, with annual zooplankton biomass anomalies 2.24 ± 1.03 times those of phytoplankton. The low latitude oceans drive the projected trophic amplification of biomass declines, with models exhibiting variable trophic interactions in the mid-to-high latitudes and similar relative changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. Under the assumption that zooplankton biomass is prey limited, an analytical explanation of the trophic amplification that occurs in the low latitudes can be derived from generic plankton differential equations. Using an ocean biogeochemical model, we show that the inclusion of variable C:N:P phytoplankton stoichiometry can substantially increase the trophic amplification of biomass declines in low latitude regions. This additional trophic amplification is driven by enhanced nutrient limitation decreasing phytoplankton N and P content relative to C, hence reducing zooplankton growth efficiency. Given that most current Earth System Models assume that phytoplankton C:N:P stoichiometry is constant, such models are likely to underestimate the extent of negative trophic amplification under projected climate change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; food quality; marine primary production; plankton; stoichiometry; trophic amplification,"Animals; Biomass; Climate Change; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Zooplankton; biomass; climate change; climate effect; food quality; food web; marine ecosystem; phytoplankton; primary production; stoichiometry; trophic level; zooplankton; animal; biological model; biomass; climate change; food chain; physiology; phytoplankton; sea; zooplankton",,,,,"CIGOEF; FP7 IS-ENES2; FP7 IS‐ENES2, (312979); US Department of Energy; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (861002); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR‐17‐ CE32‐0008); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; Université Pierre et Marie Curie, UPMC, (ANR-10-LABX-0018); Horizon 2020, (610028, 641816, IMBALANCE‐P)","Funding text 1: This study has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 641816 (CRESCENDO) and No 610028 (IMBALANCE-P), and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche grant agreement ANR-17-CE32-0008 (CIGOEF).

Here we build up on a previous study to characterize the diversity of all beetles attracted to different commonly used streetlight set ups. We find that lights attract beetles from a broad taxonomic and ecological spectrum. Lights that attract a large number of insect individuals draw an equally high number of insect species. While there is some evidence for heterogeneity in the preference of beetle species to different kinds of light, all species are more attracted to some light radiating ultraviolet. The functional basis of this heterogeneity, however, is not clear. Our results highlight that control of ultraviolet radiation in public lighting is important to reduce the number and diversity of insects attracted to lights. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia",Coleoptera; Insects; Light pollution; Lighting; Ultraviolet,,,,,,,,"Arnett Ross H., Thomas M.C., Skelley P.E., Frank J.H., American Beetles, vol.

Habitat disturbances are predicted to favor behaviorally flexible species capable of adapting to altered environments. When artificial light at night (ALAN) is introduced into urban areas, it has the potential to impede reproduction of local firefly populations by obscuring their bioluminescent courtship signals. Whether individual fireflies can brighten their signals to maintain visibility against an illuminated background remains unknown. In this study, we exposed male Aquatica ficta fireflies to diffused light of varying wavelength and intensity, and recorded their alarm flash signals. When exposed to wavelengths at or below 533 nm, males emitted brighter signals with decreased frequency. This is the first evidence of individual-level light signal plasticity in fireflies. In contrast, long wavelength ambient light ( 597 nm) did not affect signal morphology, likely because A. ficta cannot perceive these wavelengths. These results suggest long wavelength lighting is less likely to impact firefly courtship, and its use in place of broad spectrum white lighting could augment firefly conservation efforts. More generally, this study demonstrates benefits of bioluminescent signal plasticity in a “noisy” signaling environment, and sheds light on an important yet understudied consequence of urbanization.

In birds, broad-spectrum white ALAN can have disruptive effects on activity patterns, metabolism, stress response and immune function. There has been growing research on whether the use of alternative light spectra can reduce these negative effects, but surprisingly, there has been no study to determine which light spectrum birds prefer. To test such a preference, we gave urban and forest great tits (Parus major) the choice where to roost using pairwise combinations of darkness, white light or green dim light at night (1.5 lux). Birds preferred to sleep under artificial light instead of darkness, and green was preferred over white light. In a subsequent experiment, we investigated the consequence of sleeping under a particular light condition, and measured birds' daily activity levels, daily energy expenditure (DEE), oxalic acid as a biomarker for sleep debt and cognitive abilities. White light affected activity patterns more than green light. Moreover, there was an origin-dependent response to spectral composition: in urban birds, the total daily activity and night activity did not differ between white and green light, while forest birds were more active under white than green light. We also found that individuals who slept under white and green light had higher DEE. However, there were no differences in oxalic acid levels or cognitive abilities between light treatments. Thus, we argue that in naive birds that had never encountered light at night, white light might disrupt circadian rhythms more than green light. However, it is possible that the negative effects of ALAN on sleep and cognition might be observed only under intensities higher than 1.5 lux. These results suggest that reducing the intensity of light pollution as well as tuning the spectrum towards long wavelengths may considerably reduce its impact. © 2019 Royal Society Publishing.

Despite its widespread use and numerous potential ecological effects, few studies have investigated the impacts on aquatic ecosystems and primary producers. Light is a source of energy and information for benthic autotrophs that form the basis of food webs in clear, shallow waters. Artificial night-time illumination may thus affect biomass and community composition of primary producers. We experimentally mimicked the light conditions of a light-polluted area (approximately 20 lux, white LED) in streamside flumes on a sub-alpine stream. We compared the biomass and community composition of periphyton grown under ALAN with periphyton grown under a natural light regime in two seasons using communities in early (up to 3 weeks) and later (4–6 weeks) developmental stages. In early periphyton, ALAN decreased the biomass of autotrophs in both spring (57% at 3 weeks) and autumn (43% at 2 weeks), decreased the proportion of cyanobacteria in spring (54%), and altered the proportion of diatoms in autumn (11% decrease at 2 weeks and 5% increase at 3 weeks). No effects of ALAN were observed for later periphyton. Further work is needed to test whether streams with frequent physical disturbances that reset the successional development of periphyton are more affected by ALAN than streams with more stable conditions. As periphyton is a fundamental component of stream ecosystems, the impact of ALAN might propagate to higher trophic levels and/or affect critical ecosystem functions. © 2017 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Bacillariophyta; Cyanobacteria; aquatic ecosystem; benthos; biodiversity; biomass; community composition; developmental stage; diatom; ecosystem function; environmental change; food web; freshwater ecosystem; light intensity; periphyton; primary production; seasonal variation; shallow water; stream; subalpine environment; trophic level,,,,,,,"Allan J.D., Castillo M.M., Stream ecology: Structure and function of running waters, (2007); Aube M., Roby J., Kocifaj M., Evaluating potential spectral impacts of various artificial lights on melatonin suppression, photosynthesis, and star visibility, PLoS One, 8, (2013); (2013); Becker A., Whitfield A.K., Cowley P.D., Jarnegren J., Naesje T.F., Potential effects of artificial light associated with anthropogenic infrastructure on the abundance and foraging behaviour of estuary-associated fishes, J.

Many studies document the physiological costs of light at night, but far fewer have focused on the potential benefits for nocturnal insectivores and the likely ecological consequences of shifts in predator–prey relationships. We investigated the effects of ALAN on the foraging behaviour and prey capture success in juvenile Australian garden orb-web spiders (Eriophora biapicata). Laboratory experiments demonstrated that juvenile spiders were attracted to LED lights when choosing foraging sites, but prey availability was a stronger cue for remaining in a foraging site. Field experiments revealed a significant increase in prey capture rates for webs placed near LED lights. This suggests that any physiological costs of light at night may be offset by the foraging benefits, perhaps partially explaining recently observed increases in the size, fecundity and abundance of some orb-web spider species in urban environments. Our results highlight the potential long-term consequences of night lighting in urban ecosystems, through the impact of orb-web spiders on insect populations. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",araneidae; light pollution; prey capture; trade-off; urbanisation; web architecture,Araneae; Araneidae; Hexapoda; abundance; architecture; behavioral response; fecundity; foraging behavior; juvenile; light effect; light pollution; nocturnal activity; physiology; predator-prey interaction; prey availability; prey capture; spider; trade-off; urbanization,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP150101191); Hermon Slade Foundation, (HSF 14/, HSF 14/4); Australian National Botanic Gardens, ANBG","Funding text 1: We thank Caitlin Selleck, Lucy McLay, Caitlyn Perry and Po Peng for their help with spider maintenance; Caitlin Selleck, Patricia Koh, Olivia Keegan, Lachlan Tegart, Anne Aulsebrook, Gareth Hopkins, and Marty Lockett for fieldwork assistance; Caitlin Selleck and Patricia Koh for their comments on the manuscript; and Peter Symes and Colin Walker for facilitating fieldwork in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.

Investment in riparian forest restoration has received relatively little attention, in part due to their relatively small spatial extent. Yet, riparian forest restoration may be a particularly valuable strategy because riparian forests have the potential for rapid carbon sequestration, are hotspots of biodiversity, and provide numerous valuable ecosystem services. To inform this strategy, we conducted a global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that riparian forests hold on average 68–158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity, with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term ecosystem service returns. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",carbon accounting; carbon credits; climate change; floodplain; multiple benefits; payment for ecosystem services; riparian restoration,"Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Models, Biological; Soil; Trees; carbon; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; land degradation; restoration ecology; riparian forest; stock assessment; strategic approach; biodiversity; biological model; biomass; carbon sequestration; chemistry; climate change; environmental protection; forest; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; soil; tree",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ; Soil, ",,,"Point Blue Conservation Science; UC Cooperative; Marin Community Foundation, MCF; Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California, UCANR, (2205); Nature Conservancy, TNC","Support was provided by the S.

EIP is known to be temperature-dependent but this relationship is surprisingly poorly characterized. There is a single degree-day model for EIP of Plasmodium falciparum that derives from a limited number of poorly controlled studies conducted almost a century ago. Here, we show that the established degree-day model greatly underestimates the rate of development of P. falciparum in both Anopheles stephensi and An. gambiae mosquitoes at temperatures in the range of 17-20°C. We also show that realistic daily temperature fluctuation further speeds parasite development. These novel results challenge one of the longest standing models in malaria biology and have potentially important implications for understanding the impacts of future climate change. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Since the early 20th century their expansion has been accompanied by increasing illumination of the environment at night, a trend that is likely to continue over the decades to come. Consequently, a growing proportion of the world's ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night, profoundly altering natural cycles of light and darkness. While in recent years there have been advances in our understanding of the effects of artificial light at night on the behaviour and physiology of animals in the wild, much less is known about the impacts on wild plants and natural or semi-natural vegetation composition. This is surprising, as effects of low-intensity light at night on flowering, phenology and growth form are well known in laboratory and greenhouse studies. In a long-term experimental field study we exposed a semi-natural grassland to artificial light at intensities and wavelengths typical of those experienced by roadside vegetation under street lighting. We found that lighting affected the trajectory of vegetation change, leading to significant differences in biomass and plant cover in the dominant species. Changes in flowering phenology were variable between years, with grass species flowering between 4 days earlier and 12 days later under artificial light. Policy implications. Our results demonstrate that artificial light, at levels equivalent to those in street-lit environments, can affect species composition in semi-natural vegetation. This highlights the importance of considering artificial light as a driver of vegetation change in urban, suburban and semi-natural ecosystems, and where possible, of minimising or excluding artificial light from habitats of conservation importance. © 2017 The Authors.

Nowadays, many animals are also exposed to artificial night lighting (often referred to as light pollution). Animals strongly rely on variation in light levels to time their daily and seasonal behaviour. Previous work on passerine birds showed that artificial night lighting leads to earlier onset of dawn song. However, these studies were carried out at intermediate latitudes with more limited seasonal changes in daylength, and we still lack an understanding of the impact of artificial night lighting in relation to variation in natural light conditions. We investigated the influence of natural and artificial light conditions on the timing of dawn singing in five common songbird species in each of three regions in Europe that differed in natural variation in daylength (northern Finland, 65°N; southern Germany, 48°N; southern Spain, 37°N). In each region, we selected five peri-urban forest sites with and five without street lighting, and we recorded dawn singing at the beginning of the local breeding season. Our results show that the earliest natural singers, that is, European robins (Erithacus rubecula) and common blackbirds (Turdus merula), started dawn singing earlier along with the natural increase in night brightness in Finland, with no additional effects of artificial night lighting. In contrast, the later singers, such as, great tits (Parus major), blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs), showed similar onsets of dawn song relative to sunrise across the season and similar effects of artificial night lighting at all latitudes. Artificial night lighting affected great tits, blue tits and chaffinches even in northern Finland where nights became very bright. Proximate factors such as differential light sensitivities may explain why early singers showed more plastic behavioural responses to naturally and artificially bright nights.

Six treatments L0 (Light with no fish), N0 (No light, with no fish), LT (Light with O. mossambicus), NT (No light with O. mossambicus), LC (Light with C. gariepinus) and NC (No light with C. gariepinus) were randomly assigned to aquadams and replicated three times. Two hundred O. mossambicus (60 ± 0.6 g) and 100 C. gariepinus (90 ± 0.8 g) were stocked to assigned aquadams. Two other treatments designated FT (O. mossambicus fed on pellets) and FC (C. gariepinus fed on pellets), were added. SGR was higher (0.31 g/day) in O. mossambicus subjected to night-time lighting than those that were not (0.05 g/day). C. gariepinus under the night-time lighting also had a higher SGR (0.30 g/day) than the ones that were not (0.26 g/day). However, in both species the growth rate was lower when compared to those fed on commercial pellets. Oreochromis mossambicus benefited more from night-time lighting. The most abundant aerial insects were moths and beetles. The serial slaughter method was used to determine the gastric evacuation rate of moths and beetles in O. mossambicus and C. gariepinus. Moths were evacuated faster (−0.235) than beetles (−0.108) in O. mossambicus. In C. gariepinus, the gastric evacuation of moths was also faster (−0.40) than beetles (−0.36). This implies digestion efficiency was higher in moths than beetles. Water physico-chemical variables were analysed once a week and they were not affected by night-time lighting. © 2017 Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Firenze.",beetles;

In otherwise dark environments, street lights restrict the use of major flight routes by some bats, including the threatened lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros, and may disrupt foraging. Using radio tracking, we examined the response of individual female R. hipposideros to experimental street lights placed on hedgerows used as major flight routes. Hedgerows were illuminated on one side over four nights using lights with different emission spectra, while the opposite side of the hedge was not illuminated. Automated bat detectors were used to examine changes in overall bat activity by R. hipposideros and other bat species present. R. hipposideros activity reduced significantly under all light types, including red light, challenging a previously held assumption that red light is safe for bats. Despite this, R. hipposideros rapidly adapted to the presence of lights by switching their flight paths to the dark side of the hedgerow, enabling them to reach foraging sites without restriction. Red light had no effect on the activity of the other species present. Slow-flying Myotis spp. avoided orange, white and green light, while more agile Pipistrellus spp. were significantly more active at these light types compared to dark controls, most probably in response to accumulations of insect prey. No effect of any light type was found for Nyctalus or Eptesicus spp. Our findings demonstrate that caution must be used when promoting forms of lighting that are thought to be safe for wildlife before they are tested more widely. We argue that it is essential to preserve dark corridors to mitigate the impacts of artificial light at night on bat activity and movements. © 2018 The Authors Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",artificial light at night;

Exposure to unnatural lighting environments may have profound effects on animal physiology, particularly during early life. Here, we experimentally investigated for the first time the impact of ALAN on body mass and oxidative status during development, using nestlings of a free-living songbird, the great tit (Parus major), an important model species. Body mass and blood oxidative status were determined at baseline (=13 days after hatching) and again after a two night exposure to ALAN. Because it is very difficult to generalise the oxidative status from one or two measures we relied on a multi-biomarker approach. We determined multiple metrics of both antioxidant defences and oxidative damage: molecular antioxidants GSH, GSSG; antioxidant enzymes GPX, SOD, CAT; total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and damage markers protein carbonyls and TBARS. Light exposed nestlings showed no increase in body mass, in contrast to unexposed individuals. None of the metrics of oxidative status were affected. Nonetheless, our study provides experimental field evidence that ALAN may negatively affect free-living nestlings' development and hence may have adverse consequences lasting throughout adulthood. © 2016 The Author(s).",,"Animals; Antioxidants; Blood Chemical Analysis; Body Weight; Environmental Pollution; Light; Lighting; Oxidative Stress; Songbirds; antioxidant; animal; blood analysis; body weight; growth, development and aging; illumination; light; oxidative stress; physiology; pollution; songbird",,"Antioxidants, ",,,,,"Holker F., Wolter C., Perkin E.K., Tockner K., Light pollution as a biodiversity threat, Trends Ecol.

I used echolocation detectors to uncover the impact of artificial lighting on insectivorous bat (Chiroptera) species in Melbourne's south-east. Surveys were undertaken in native vegetation at a lit treatment, which was illuminated by a street light, and an unlit treatment, which was dark. Bat activity and species richness at unlit treatments was significantly higher when compared with lit treatments. The temperature at which the greatest activity occurred was ∼2°C higher at unlit treatments than lit treatments. Bat activity at both the lit and unlit treatments increased rapidly after sunset. Bat activity moderately decreased during the night at lit treatments until sunrise, whilst activity at unlit treatments remained steady throughout the night before rapidly decreasing two hours before sunrise. The negative effect of artificial lighting on bat activity and species in urban areas may have major long-term implications on the ecology of urban areas. © Australian Mammal Society 2017.",echolocation;

Some personality types within a species might be better suited to cope with environmental change and therefore might be selected upon under ongoing urbanization. Results: We used LED street lamps in a large outdoor enclosure to experimentally investigate the effects of ALAN on activity patterns, movement and interaction of individuals of two species, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). We analyzed effects combined with individual boldness score. Both species reduced their activity budget during daylight hours. While under natural light conditions home ranges were larger during daylight than during nighttime, this difference vanished under ALAN. Conspecifics showed reduced home range overlap, proximity and activity synchrony when subjected to nighttime illumination. Changes in movement patterns in reaction to ALAN were not associated with differences in boldness score of individuals. Conclusions: Our results suggest that light pollution can lead to changes in movement patterns and individual interactions in small mammals. This could lead to fitness consequences on the population level. © 2019 The Author(s).",Animal personality; HIREC; Interspecific interactions; Nighttime illumination; Outdoor enclosure; Rodents,Animals; Arvicolinae; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Light; Personality; Photoperiod; Urbanization; Animalia; Apodemus agrarius; Clethrionomys glareolus; Mammalia; Rodentia; anthropogenic effect; fitness; interspecific interaction; light effect; light pollution; rodent; space use; animal; Arvicolinae; human; light; personality; photoperiodicity; pollution; urbanization,,,,,"Universität Potsdam, UP",The Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) funded JHs studies on effects of light pollution (reference number: 20015/374) and the German Science Foundation (DFG-GRK 2118/1 BioMove: Biodiversity and Movement Ecology) funded AS.

However, there are currently no data on the effects of ocean acidification on iodine metabolism in kelp. As key primary producers in coastal ecosystems worldwide, any change in their iodine metabolism caused by climate change will potentially have important consequences for global geochemical cycles of iodine, including iodine levels of coastal food webs that underpin the nutrition of billions of humans around the world. Here, we found that elevated pCO                             2                              enhanced growth and increased iodine accumulation not only in the model kelp Saccharina japonica using both short-term laboratory experiment and long-term in situ mesocosms, but also in several other edible and ecologically significant seaweeds using long-term in situ mesocosms. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of S. japonica revealed that most vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase genes involved in iodine efflux during oxidative stress are down-regulated under increasing pCO                             2                             , suggesting that ocean acidification alleviates oxidative stress in kelp, which might contribute to their enhanced growth. When consumed by abalone (Haliotis discus), elevated iodine concentrations in S. japonica caused increased iodine accumulation in abalone, accompanied by reduced synthesis of thyroid hormones. Thus, our results suggest that kelp will benefit from ocean acidification by a reduction in environmental stress however; iodine levels, in kelp-based coastal food webs will increase, with potential impacts on biogeochemical cycles of iodine in coastal ecosystems.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",iodine metabolism; kelp; ocean acidification; Saccharina japonica; thyroid hormone; vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase,Animals; Chlorophyta; Climate Change; Food Chain; Gastropoda; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iodine; Kelp; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Haliotidae; Haliotis discus; Japonica; Laminaria japonica; iodine; sea water; alga; concentration (composition); endocrine system; food web; hormone; iodine; metabolism; ocean acidification; animal; chemistry; climate change; food chain; gastropod; green alga; kelp; metabolism; pH; sea,,"iodine, 7553-56-2; Iodine, ",,,"AoShan Talents Program, (2015ASTPES03); Shandong key Research and Development Plan, (2018GHY115010); Special Scientific Research Funds for Central Non‐ Profit Institutes; Taishan Scholars Funding; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41676145); Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, CAFS, (20603022016001, 20603022016010); Agriculture Research System of China, (CARS‐50); Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology Bureau, (17‐1‐1‐96‐jch); Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, YSFRI, CAFS; Central University Basic Scientific Research Business Expenses Special Funds; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (JQ201509)","Funding text 1: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41676145; Shandong key Research and Development Plan, Grant/Award Number: 2018GHY115010; Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology plan project, Grant/ Award Number: 17-1-1-96-jch; Special Scientific Research Funds for Central Non‐ Profit Institutes, Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 20603022016010; China Agriculture Research System, Grant/Award Number: CARS-50; Taishan Scholars Funding; AoShan Talents Program, Grant/Award Number: 2015ASTPES03; Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shandong Province, Grant/Award Number: JQ201509; Funding text 2: We thank F.

In this study, we asked if artificial nighttime lighting affects the performance in monoculture of four grass species: the Eurasian Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz.) S.T. Blake (Poaceae), and Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng (Poaceae); and the North American Panicum virgatum (L.) (Poaceae), and Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash (Poaceae). We conducted a field pot experiment to test for the effects of artificial nighttime lighting and plant density on height, biomass, and leaf number. Height of the tallest individual per population was affected by separate interactions between species and density, light, and time. Final total biomass per individual biomass was increased under nighttime lighting, but more so at low density. Leaf number was increased by artificial nighttime lighting irrespective of species. These results suggest that artificial nighttime lighting may have previously undocumented influences on plant height, biomass, and leaf number within certain species. These findings warrant more in-depth studies into the role that artificial nighttime lighting can have on various plant species. © Copyright 2018 by The Torrey Botanical Society.",artificial nighttime lighting; Bothriochloa bladhii; Bothriochloa ischaemum; light pollution; Panicum virgatum; Sorghastrum nutans,Bothriochloa bladhii; Bothriochloa ischaemum; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Sorghastrum nutans; biomass; experimental design; field method; grass; light pollution; monoculture,,,,,,,"Bennie J., Davies T.W., Cruse D., Gaston K.J., Ecological effects of artificial light at night on wild plants, J.

Colonially reproducing species are particularly vulnerable to localised disturbances because detrimental elements can simultaneously affect the entire population. Studies of petrels and shearwaters have shown that light pollution, in particular, can be harmful for both fledglings and adults, but little is known of the way such anthropogenic elements affect the quality of parental care at the nest. Chick provisioning in petrels and shearwaters occurs exclusively at night and is also negatively correlated with the amount of moonlight. We tested the hypothesis that high-intensity light and sound disturbances will disrupt nest attendance and thus affect weight gain in chicks but that the magnitude of such effects would be modulated by moonlight conditions. We measured the effect of two outdoor disco events on overnight weight gain in 26 chicks of Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) from a breeding colony on Linosa Island. The two disco events occurred under contrasting moonlight conditions (moonless vs moonlight). Chicks situated closer to the disturbance gained significantly less weight compared to conspecifics from nests further away but the effect was only evident on the moonless night.Our results suggest that light and sound disturbances can have a negative effect on parental care in C. diomedea but moonlight might moderate the bird’s perception and thus the magnitude of the disturbance. However, while occasional disturbances may impact short-term weight gain in C. diomedea chicks, such effects are not perceivable at fledging when measured as differences in the weight or the date at which they left the nest. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial light disturbance; Conservation on islands; Moonlight; Scopoli’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea); Sound disturbance,,,,,,,,"Albores-Barajas Y.V., Soldatini C., Furness R.W., Are burrow nesting seabird chicks affected by human disturbance?, Waterbirds, 32, 4, pp. 572-578, (2009); Bourgeois K., Dromzee S., Vidal E., Legrand J., Yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan presence and behaviour at colonies: not only a moonlight question, C R Biol, 331, 1, pp. 88-97, (2008); Bretagnolle V., Acoustic communication in a group of nonpasserine birds, the petrels, Ecology and evolution of acoustic communication in birds, pp. 160-178, (1996); Cianchetti-Benedetti M., Catoni C., Kato A., Massa B., Quillfeldt P., A new algorithm for the identification of dives reveals the foraging ecology of a shallow-diving seabird using accelerometer data, Mar Biol, 164, 4, (2017); Croxall J.P., Butchart S.H., Lascelles B., Stattersfield A.J., Sullivan B., Symes A., Taylor P., Seabird conservation status, threats and priority actions: a global assessment, Bird Conserv Int, 22, 1, pp. 1-34, (2012); Cure C., Mathevon N., Aubin T., Mate vocal recognition in the Scopoli’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea: do females and males share the same acoustic code?, Behav Process, 128, pp. 96-102, (2016); Hamer K.C., Hill J.K., Variation and regulation of meal size and feeding frequency in Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea, J Anim Ecol, 62, pp. 441-450, (1993); Le Corre M., Ollivier A., Ribes S., Jouventin P., Light-induced mortality of petrels: a 4-year study from Réunion Island (Indian Ocean), Biol Conserv, 105, 1, pp. 93-102, (2002); Massa B., Lo Valvo M., Biometrical and biological considerations on the Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea, Mediterranean Marine Avifauna, pp. 293-313, (1986); Montevecchi W., Influences of artificial light on marine birds, Ecological consequences of artificial night lighting, pp. 94-113, (2006); Mougeot F., Bretagnolle V., Predation risk and moonlight avoidance in nocturnal seabirds, J Avian Biol, 31, 3, pp. 376-386, (2000); Muller M.S., Massa B., Phillips R.A., Dell'Omo G., Seabirds mated for life migrate separately to the same places: behavioural coordination or shared proximate causes?, Anim Behav, 102, pp. 267-276, (2015); Oro D., De Leon A., Minguez E., Furness R.W., Estimating predation on breeding European storm-petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus) by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), J Zool, 265, pp. 421-429, (2005); Paleczny M., Hammill E., Karpouzi V., Pauly D., Population trend of the world’s monitored seabirds, 1950-2010, PLoS One, 10, 6, (2015); Pinheiro J., Bates D., Debroy S., Sarkar D., Nlme: linear and nonlinear mixed effects models.

In mobile organisms attracted to artificial lights, the effect of light pollution on these interactions may be intensified. If organisms are repelled by artificial lights, effects of light pollution on intra- and inter-specific interactions may be diminished as organisms move away. However, organisms repelled by artificial lights would likely lose suitable habitat as light pollution expands. Thus, we investigated how light pollution affects both net attraction or repulsion of organisms and effects on intra- and inter-specific interactions. In manipulative field studies using fireflies, we found that Photuris versicolor and Photinus pyralis fireflies were lured to artificial (LED) light at night and that both species were less likely to engage in courtship dialogues (bioluminescent flashing) in light-polluted field plots. Light pollution also lowered the mating success of P. pyralis. P. versicolor is known to prey upon P. pyralis by mimicking the flash patterns of P. pyralis, but we did not find an effect of light pollution on Photuris–Photinus predator–prey interactions. Our study suggests, that for some nocturnal insects, light-polluted areas may act as demographic traps, i.e., areas where immigration exceeds emigration and inhibition of courtship dialogues and mating reduces reproduction. Examining multiple factors affecting population growth in concert is needed to understand and mitigate impacts of light pollution on wildlife. © 2018 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Artificial light; Courtship; Population sink; Predator–prey,,,,,,University of Virginia Department of Environmental Sciences,"We thank two anonymous reviewers for providing helpful comments on a previous draft of this manuscript.

We tested the direct effects of light pollution on herbivore performance as well as indirect effects mediated by host plant quality. We found that artificial light from streetlights alters plant toughness. Additionally, we found evidence of both direct and indirect effects of light pollution on the performance of an herbivorous insect, which indicates that streetlights can have cascading impacts on multiple trophic levels. Our novel findings suggest that light pollution can alter plant–insect interactions and thus may have important community-wide consequences. © 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",anthropogenic disturbance; continuous photoperiod; Lepidoptera; light pollution,"Animals; Bromus; Herbivory; Larva; Light; Moths; animal; Bromus; growth, development and aging; herbivory; larva; light; moth; radiation response",,,,,City and County of Broomfield; City of Lakewood; City of Louisville; South Suburban Parks and Recreation District; University of Denver's Organismal Biology Group,"We would like to thank the City and County of Broomfield, the City of Lakewood, the City of Louisville, and the South Suburban Parks and Recreation District for use of field sites.

Circadian clocks are increasingly recognised as being key for health. Environmental light is the key stimulus that synchronises the internal circadian system with the external time cues. There are emergent health concerns regarding increasing worldwide prevalence of electric lighting, especially man-made light-at-night, and light's impact on the circadian system may be central to these effects. A number of previous studies have demonstrated increased depression-like behaviour in various rodent experimental models exposed to dim light-at-night. In this study we set out to study the impact of dim light-at-night on circadian and affective behaviours in C57Bl/6 mice. We set out specifically to examine the impact of sex on light at night's effects, as well as the impact of housing conditions. We report minimal impact of light-at-night on circadian and affective behaviours, as measured by the tail suspension test, the forced swim test, the sucrose preference test and the elevated plus maze. Light-at-night was also not associated with an increase in body weight, but was associated with a decrease in the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in the dentate gyrus. In summary, we conclude that experimental contextual factors, such as model species or strain, may be considerable importance in the investigation of the impact of light at night on mood-related parameters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Circadian; Ki-67; Light-at-night; Mood; Mouse,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Weight; Cell Proliferation; Circadian Rhythm; Dentate Gyrus; Depression; Female; Housing, Animal; Ki-67 Antigen; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Photoperiod; Sex Characteristics; Ki 67 antigen; Ki 67 antigen; Mki67 protein, mouse; affect; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal housing; anxiety disorder; Article; body weight; cell proliferation; circadian rhythm; controlled study; dentate gyrus; depression; elevated plus maze test; female; forced swim test; light; locomotion; male; mouse; night; nonhuman; priority journal; sucrose preference test; tail suspension test; time spent in open arms; animal; animal behavior; C57BL mouse; circadian rhythm; metabolism; pathophysiology; photoperiodicity; physiology; sexual characteristics",,"Ki-67 Antigen, ; Mki67 protein, mouse, ",,,,,"Falchi F., Cinzano P., Duriscoe D., Kyba C.C., Elvidge C.D., Baugh K., Portnov B.A., Rybnikova N.A., Furgoni R., The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness, Sci.

Understanding the spatial patterns of Nmin, its temperature sensitivity (Q10) and regulatory mechanisms is critical for improving the management of soil nutrients. In this study, we evaluated 379 peer-reviewed scientific papers to explore how Nmin and the Q10 of Nmin varied among different ecosystems and regions at the global scale. The results showed that Nmin varied significantly among different ecosystems with a global average of 2.41 mg N soil kg−1 day−1. Furthermore, Nmin significantly decreased with increasing latitude and altitude. The Q10 varied significantly among different ecosystems with a global average of 2.21, ranging from the highest found in forest soils (2.43) and the lowest found for grassland soils (1.67) and significantly increased with increasing latitude. Path analyses indicated that Nmin was primarily affected by the content of soil organic carbon (C), soil C:N ratio, and clay content, where Q10 was primarily influenced by the soil C:N ratio and soil pH. Furthermore, the activation energy (Ea) of soil N mineralization was significantly and negative correlated with the substrate quality index among all ecosystems, indicating the applicability of the carbon quality temperature hypothesis to soil N mineralization at a global scale. These findings provided empirical evidence supporting that soil N availability, under global warming scenarios, is expected to increase stronger in colder regions as compared with that low-latitude regions due to the higher Q10. This may alleviate the restriction of N supply for increased primary productivity at higher latitudes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",activation energy; global pattern; mechanism; mineralization; nitrogen availability;

Identifying and exploring the impacts of nightlight pollution upon species behavior, ecology and population dynamics could enhance conservation capacity. Sea turtle hatchlings emerge from nest at night and use visual cues to direct towards the brightest and lowest horizon, eventually leading them to the sea. Nightlight pollution could alter the cues perceived, disorienting the fragile hatchlings. We examined the level of artificial lighting and orientation patterns of sea turtles hatchling, in Zakynthos Island, Greece, one of the main nesting rookeries of the loggerheads (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean Sea. We analyzed movement patterns of 5967 hatchlings from 230 nests, and demonstrate that nightlight pollution could reduce population recruitment by more than 7%, suggesting that mitigation measures should become a high conservation priority. Our results further suggest that the responses of sea turtle hatchlings to artificial nighttime lighting could vary significantly depending on various factors, either anthropogenic or natural. Local conditions operating at the nesting site level determine the fine scale responses of hatchlings, thus conservation measures should be drawn in respect to site-specific properties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Coastal lighting; Disorientation; Light pollution; Marine turtles; Sea-finding,Aegean Islands; Greece; Ionian Islands; Mediterranean Sea; Zakynthos [Ionian Islands]; Caretta caretta; Cheloniidae; Biodiversity; Conservation; Marine pollution; % reductions; Artificial lighting; Coastal lighting; Disorientation; Light pollution; Marine turtle; Mediterranean region; Sea turtles; Sea-finding; Visual cues; anthropogenic source; biodiversity; hatching; light pollution; population dynamics; recruitment (population dynamics); site selection; turtle; Lighting,,,,,"Management Agency; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER",This study was supported by the Management Agency of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos in the framework of the project ‘Monitoring of the oviposition of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta in Laganas Bay’ funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and National resources (Operational Programme ‘Environment and Sustainable Development’ under the NSRF 2007–2013).

Advanced analytical methods for estimating abundance of unmarked, open populations now incorporate population growth models and simultaneously test for covariate effects on abundance and detection probability. However, estimating population abundance at a staging site is complicated by daily immigration and emigration of unmarked individuals. We applied a set of generalized N-mixture models to simulated count data to test their applicability for transient populations. Using simulated datasets, parameters were unbiased when the apparent survival rate varied within a season or was mis-specified in a model, but not when the immigration or detection probability was mis-specified. With knowledge from the simulated data, we applied these models to daily counts of staging migratory shorebirds and estimated daily abundances accounting for variation in the detection and immigration rates. Daily counts of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) staging at Westhampton Island, New York, were collected during northward migration (1997–1999). We tested the effects of weather and tides on detection probability, and we modelled within-season variation in immigration rates as a function of time. Covariates affecting the detection probability differed among years, but tide height consistently was correlated with detection probability. Accounting for detection and immigration rates, the predicted maximum single-day populations of ruddy turnstones were 172%, 165% and 129% of the observed counts for each year. Synthesis and applications. Management and conservation plans for migratory species require abundance estimates that are near the true population size though they are difficult to obtain. Our study is the first empirical application of the generalized N-mixture model that incorporates temporal trends in immigration and estimates daily abundance of a staging unmarked migratory population. Despite its inherent limitation, we suggest that the generalized N-mixture model can estimate the abundance of transient populations with low individual heterogeneity when counts are intensively surveyed. Correct estimation of population sizes and the environmental factors affecting them can aid the conservation prioritization of species and staging sites. Moreover, the use of generalized N-mixture models can improve our understanding of the environmental factors that shape migratory movements. © 2018 The Authors.

ALAN can seriously disrupt physiological systems that follow circadian rhythms, and may be particularly influential early in life, when developmental trajectories are sensitive to stressful conditions. Using great tits (Parus major) as a model species, we experimentally examined how ALAN affects physiological stress in developing nestlings. We used a repeated-measure design to assess effects of ALAN on telomere shortening, body mass, tarsus length and body condition. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences that protect chromosomes from damage and malfunction. Early-life telomere shortening can be accelerated by environmental stressors, and has been linked to later-life declines in survival and reproduction. We also assayed nitric oxide, as an additional metric of physiological stress, and determined fledging success. Change in body condition between day 8 and 15 differed according to treatment. Nestlings exposed to ALAN displayed a trend towards a decline in condition, whereas control nestlings displayed a trend towards increased condition. This pattern was driven by a greater increase in tarsus length relative to mass in nestlings exposed to ALAN. Nestlings in poorer condition and nestlings that were smaller than their nest mates had shorter telomeres. However, exposure to ALAN was unrelated to telomere shortening, and also had no effect on nitric oxide concentrations or fledging success. Thus, exposure to ALAN may not have led to sufficient stress to induce telomere shortening. Indeed, plasticity in other physiological systems could allow nestlings to maintain telomere length despite moderate stress. Alternatively, the cascade of physiological and behavioral responses associated with light exposure may have no net effect on telomere dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial light at night; Body condition; Developmental stress; Nitric oxide; Parus major; Telomeres,"Animals; Belgium; Body Composition; Female; Light; Lighting; Male; Nitric Oxide; Songbirds; Stress, Physiological; Telomere Shortening; Parus major; Passeri; Nitric oxide; Pallets; Physiological models; Physiology; nitric oxide; nitric oxide; Anthropogenic disturbance; Artificial light; Body condition; Environmental stressors; Nucleotide sequences; Parus major; Physiological systems; Telomeres; behavioral response; body condition; DNA; experimental study; field method; light effect; nitric oxide; oxidative stress; passerine; physiological response; animal behavior; Article; artificial light at night; bioassay; body mass; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental stress; field experiment; light; nestling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Parus major; physiological stress; plasticity; priority journal; reproducibility; telomere length; telomere shortening; animal; Belgium; blood; body composition; female; growth, development and aging; illumination; light; male; physiology; songbird; Chromosomes",,"nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; Nitric Oxide, ",,,"Marie Skłodowska-Curie, (1.1.044.15N, 1.2I35.17N, G052117N, G0A3615N); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (799667); European Commission, EC; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; Universiteit Antwerpen","We are very grateful to Geert Eens for providing essential support during fieldwork, and for constructing the LED systems used to manipulate ALAN.

Despite the wealth of research investigating these stressors, Artificial Light Pollution at Night (ALAN) or “ecological light pollution” represents an emerging threat that has received little attention in the context of coral reefs, despite the potential of disrupting the chronobiology, physiology, behavior, and other biological processes of coral reef organisms. Scleractinian corals, the framework builders of coral reefs, depend on lunar illumination cues to synchronize their biological rhythms such as behavior, reproduction and physiology. While, light pollution (POL) may mask and lead de-synchronization of these biological rhythms process. To reveal if ALAN impacts coral physiology, we have studied two coral species, Acropora eurystoma and Pocillopora damicornis, from the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba, Red Sea, which is undergoing urban development that has led to severe POL at night. Our two experimental design data revealed that corals exposed to ALAN face an oxidative stress condition, show lower photosynthesis performances measured by electron transport rate (ETR), as well as changes in chlorophyll and algae density parameters. Testing different lights such as Blue LED and White LED spectrum showed more extreme impact in comparison to Yellow LEDs on coral physiology. The finding of this work sheds light on the emerging threat of POL and the impacts on the biology and ecology of Scleractinian corals, and will help to formulate specific management implementations to mitigate its potentially harmful impacts. © 2019 The Authors.

Prior exploration of this question has largely involved greenhouse based short-term manipulative studies with mixed results in terms of direction and magnitude of responses. To address this question in a more realistic context, we examined the effects of increased temperature and rainfall reduction on the biochemical limitations of photosynthesis using a long-term chamber-less manipulative experiment located in northern Minnesota, USA. Nine tree species from the boreal-temperate ecotone were grown in natural neighborhoods under ambient and elevated (+3.4°C) growing season temperatures and ambient or reduced (≈40% of rainfall removed) summer rainfall. Apparent rubisco carboxylation and RuBP regeneration standardized to 25°C (Vcmax25°C and Jmax25°C, respectively) were estimated based on ACi curves measured in situ over three growing seasons. Our primary objective was to test whether species would downregulate Vcmax25°C and Jmax25°C in response to warming and reduced rainfall, with such responses expected to be greatest in species with the coldest and most humid native ranges, respectively. These hypotheses were not supported, as there were no overall main treatment effects on Vcmax25°C or Jmax25°C (p >.14). However, Jmax:Vcmax ratio decreased significantly with warming (p =.0178), whereas interactions between warming and rainfall reduction on the Jmax25°C to Vcmax25°C ratio were not significant. The insensitivity of photosynthetic parameters to warming contrasts with many prior studies done under larger temperature differentials and often fixed daytime temperatures. In sum, plants growing in relatively realistic conditions under naturally varying temperatures and soil moisture levels were remarkably insensitive in terms of their Jmax25°C and Vcmax25°C when grown at elevated temperatures, reduced rainfall, or both combined. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",B4WarmED; biochemical limitation; boreal forest; experimental warming; J <sub>max</sub>                             ; rainfall reduction; V <sub>cmax</sub>                             ,Carbon Dioxide; Minnesota; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Taiga; Temperature; Trees; Minnesota; United States; carbon dioxide; ambient air; boreal forest; numerical model; photosynthesis; rainfall; sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; temperature effect; Minnesota; photosynthesis; plant leaf; season; taiga; temperature; tree,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ",,,"College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resources Sciences and Wilderness Research Foundation; Office of Biological and Environmental Research, (DE-FG02-07ER64456); U.S Department of Energy; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, DNR; Office of Science, SC; University of Minnesota, UM; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, AAES, (MN-42-030, MN-42-060)","We would like to thank to Danielle A.

Wild A. roxburghii resources face extinction due to their slow growth rate and over exploitation. The growing market demand has led to advances in the field of artificial planting of A. roxburghii. Methods to increase the economic benefits of cultivation and the production of medicinal ingredients are very useful. Methods: A. roxburghii was exposed to red light, blue light (BL), yellow light (YL), green light, or white light as supplemental lighting at night (18:00-02:00) in a greenhouse or were left in darkness (control, CK) to investigate the effects of various light qualities on growth indices, photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll fluorescence, root vitality, stomatal density, soluble proteins, sugars, and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Results: Supplementation of BL had a positive effect on A. roxburghii growth and secondary metabolite accumulation. Leaf number, stem diameter, fresh weight, dry weight, chlorophyll a content, and secondary metabolite (total flavonoids, total polyphenols) content increased significantly. YL treatment showed significantly higher soluble sugar and polysaccharide contents than the control. Discussion: BL treatment was conducive to promoting the growth and accumulation of secondary metabolites (total flavonoids, total polyphenols); YL treatment significantly increased the content of soluble sugar and polysaccharides more than the control. Polysaccharides and total flavonoids are important medicinal ingredients of Anoectochilus, so future research will focus on the combination of blue and YL. © 2018 Wang et al.",A. roxburghii; Growth indices; Light quality; Light-emitting diode; Secondary metabolite,chlorophyll; flavonoid; glucose; polyphenol; polysaccharide; protein; sugar; analysis of variance; analytical parameters; Anoectochilus roxburghii; Article; biomass distribution; blue light; centrifugation; colorimetry; controlled study; darkness; dry weight; economic aspect; environmental exploitation; fluorescence; food assistance; growth rate; illumination; light quality; metabolism; metabolite; nonhuman; nonphotochemical quenching; optical density; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; phototrophic bacterium; plant; protein content; research; root vitality; species cultivation; spectral sensitivity; spectroscopy; stomatal conductance; temperature,,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; polyphenol, 37331-26-3; protein, 67254-75-5",,,"Fujian Institute of Subtropical Botany Foundation, (20150318-1); Science and Technology Key Project of Fujian Province, (2015NZ0002-1); Science and Technology Planning Project of Xiamen City, (3502Z20151257)","Funding text 1: The following grant information was disclosed by the authors: Science and Technology Planning Project of Xiamen City: No. 3502Z20151257.

There is a crucial need to elaborate artificial lighting recommendations to mitigate its impact on wildlife. In the present study, we investigated how streetlight spatial position and light trespass impacted the use of ecological corridors by transiting bats in anthropogenic landscapes. Through a paired, in situ experiment, we estimated how streetlight distance of impact and vertical and horizontal illuminance influenced the transiting activity of 6 species and 2 genera of bats. We selected 27 pairs composed of 1 lit site and 1 control unlit site in areas practicing either part-night or full-night lighting. We recorded bat activity at 0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 m, and measured vertical and horizontal light illuminance at the 5 distance steps (range = 0.1–30.2 lx). While streetlight attraction effect was mostly limited to a 10 m radius for Pipistrellus sp. and Nyctalus sp., streetlight avoidance was detected at up to 25 and 50 m for Myotis sp. and Eptesicus serotinus, respectively. Streetlight effects on Myotis sp. and Nyctalus sp. remained after lamps were turned-off. Illuminance had a negative effect on Myotis sp. below 1 lx, a mixed effect on E. serotinus, and a positive effect on the other species, although a peak of activity was observed between 1 and 5 lx for P. pipistrellus and N. leisleri. We recommend separating streetlights from ecological corridors by at least 50 m and avoiding vertical light trespass beyond 0.1 lx to ensure their use by light-sensitive bats. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Chiroptera; Connectivity; Land-use planning; Landscape; Light pollution; Urbanization,Chiroptera; Eptesicus serotinus; Myotis; Nyctalus; Nyctalus leisleri; Pipistrellus; Pipistrellus pipistrellus; Biodiversity; Land use; Pollution; Chiroptera; Connectivity; Land Use Planning; Landscape; Light pollution; Urbanization; anthropogenic effect; bat; biodiversity; connectivity; habitat corridor; land use planning; landscape; light pollution; lightning; suburbanization; threshold; urbanization; wild population; Street lighting,,,,,,,"(2007); Arroyo-Solis A., Castillo J.M., Figueroa E., Lopez-Sanchez J.L., Slabbekoorn H., Experimental evidence for an impact of anthropogenic noise on dawn chorus timing in urban birds, Journal of Avian Biology, 44, pp. 288-296, (2013); Azam C., Kerbiriou C., Vernet A., Julien J.F., Bas Y., Plichard L., Le Viol I., Et al., Is part-night lighting an effective measure to limit the impacts of artificial lighting on bats?, Global Change Biology, 21, 12, pp. 4333-4341, (2015); Azam C., Le Viol I., Julien J.-F., Bas Y., Kerbiriou C., Disentangling the relative effect of light pollution, impervious surfaces and intensive agriculture on bat activity with a national-scale monitoring program, Landscape Ecology, 31, pp. 2471-2483, (2016); Baguette M., Blanchet S., Legrand D., Stevens V.M., Turlure C., Individual dispersal, landscape connectivity and ecological networks, Biological Reviews, 88, 2, pp. 310-326, (2013); Barataud M., Ecologie acoustique des chiroptères d'Europe, (2015); Bas Y., Escallon A., Ferre M., Haquart A., Rufray V., Disca T., Julien J.-F., (2013); Bennie J., Davies T.W., Cruse D., Inger R., Gaston K.J., Cascading effects of artificial light at night: Resource-mediated control of herbivores in a grassland ecosystem, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, (2015); Bliss-Ketchum L.L., de Rivera C.E., Turner B.C., Weisbaum D.M., The effect of artificial light on wildlife use of a passage structure, Biological Conservation, 199, (2016); Boldogh S., Dobrosi D., Samu P., The effects of the illumination of buildings on house-dwelling bats and its conservation consequences, Acta Chiropterologica, 9, 2, pp. 527-534, (2007); Charbonnier Y., Barbaro L., Theillout A., Jactel H., Numerical and functional responses of forest bats to a major insect pest in pine plantations, PLOS ONE, 9, (2014); Day J., Baker J., Schofield H., Mathews F., Gaston K.J., Part-night lighting: Implications for bat conservation, Animal Conservation, 1-5, (2015); Davies T.W., Bennie J., Cruse D., Blumgart D., Inger R., Gaston K.J., Multiple night-time light-emitting diode lighting strategies impact grassland invertebrate assemblages, Global Change Biology, 23, pp. 2641-2648, (2017); de Jong M., Jeninga L., Ouyang J.Q., van Oers K., Spoelstra K., Visser M.E., Dose-dependent responses of avian daily rhythms to artificial light at night, Physiology and Behavior, 155, pp. 172-179, (2016); Degen T., Mitesser O., Perkin E.K., Weiss N.-S., Oehlert M., Mattig E., Et al., Street lighting: Sex-independent impacts on moth movement, Journal of Animal Ecology, 85, 5, pp. 1352-1360, (2016); Dominoni D.M., Quetting M., Partecke J., Long-term effects of chronic light pollution on seasonal functions of european blackbirds (Turdus merula), PLoS One, 8, 12, (2013); Eisenbeis G., Artificial night lighting and insects: Attraction of insects to streetlamps in a rural setting in Germany, Ecological consequences of artificial night lighting, pp. 281-304, (2006); Falchi F., Cinzano P., Duriscoe D., Kyba C.C.M., Elvidge C.D., Baugh K., Et al., The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness, Science Advances, pp. 1-26, (2016); Fotios S., Uttley J., Illuminance required to detect a pavement obstacle of critical size, Lighting Research and Technology, pp. 1-15, (2016); ffrench-Constant R.H., Somers-Yeates R., Bennie J., Economou T., Hodgson D., Spalding A., Et al., Light pollution is associated with earlier tree budburst across the United Kingdom, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Despite rising concerns over their impact on the environment and human health, the flexibility of LEDs has been advocated as a means of mitigating the ecological impacts of globally widespread outdoor night-time lighting through spectral manipulation, dimming and switching lights off during periods of low demand. We conducted a three-year field experiment in which each of these lighting strategies was simulated in a previously artificial light naïve grassland ecosystem. White LEDs both increased the total abundance and changed the assemblage composition of adult spiders and beetles. Dimming LEDs by 50% or manipulating their spectra to reduce ecologically damaging wavelengths partially reduced the number of commoner species affected from seven to four. A combination of dimming by 50% and switching lights off between midnight and 04:00 am showed the most promise for reducing the ecological costs of LEDs, but the abundances of two otherwise common species were still affected. The environmental consequences of using alternative lighting technologies are increasingly well established. These results suggest that while management strategies using LEDs can be an effective means of reducing the number of taxa affected, averting the ecological impacts of night-time lighting may ultimately require avoiding its use altogether. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",artificial light at night;

Light at night is particularly problematic for bats as most species are nocturnal and often cross relatively large distances when commuting between roosts and foraging grounds. Earlier studies have shown that illumination of linear structures in the landscape disturbs commuting bats, and that the response of bats to light may strongly depend on the light spectrum. Here, we studied the impact of white, green, and red light on commuting Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii). We used a unique location where commuting bats cross a road by flying through two identical, parallel culverts underneath. We illuminated the culverts with white, red, and green light, with an intensity of 5 lux at the water surface. Bats had to choose between the two culverts, each with a different lighting condition every night. We presented all paired combinations of white, green, and red light and dark control in a factorial design. Contrary to our expectations, the number of bat passes through a culvert was unaffected by the presence of light. Furthermore, bats did not show any preference for light color. These results show that the response of commuting Daubenton's bats to different colors of light at night with a realistic intensity may be limited when passing through culverts. © The Authors.

In fish, migrations to and distribution on spawning grounds are likely influenced by both climate warming and harvesting. The Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua) performs seasonal migrations from its feeding grounds in the Barents Sea to spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast. The distribution of cod between the spawning grounds has historically changed at decadal scales, mainly due to variable use of the northern and southern margins of the spawning area. Based on historical landing records, two major hypotheses have been put forward to explain these changes: climate and harvesting. Climate could affect the distribution through, for example, spatial habitat shifts. Harvesting could affect the distribution through impacting the demographic structure. If demographic structure is important, theory predicts increasing spawner size with migration distance. Here, we evaluate these hypotheses with modern data from a period (2000–2016) of increasing temperature and recovering stock structure. We first analyze economic data from the Norwegian fisheries to investigate geographical differences in size of spawning fish among spawning grounds, as well as interannual differences in mean latitude of spawning in relation to changes in temperature and demographic parameters. Second, we analyze genetically determined fish sampled at the spawning grounds to unambiguously separate between migratory NEA cod and potentially smaller sized coastal cod of local origin. Our results indicate smaller spawners farther away from the feeding grounds, hence not supporting the hypothesis that harvesting is a main driver for the contemporary spawning ground distribution. We find a positive correlation between annual mean spawning latitude and temperature. In conclusion, based on contemporary data, there is more support for climate compared to harvesting in shaping spawning ground distribution in this major fish stock in the North Atlantic Ocean. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; demography; economic data; genetic data; size truncation; spawning distribution,Animal Distribution; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Climate Change; Fisheries; Gadus morhua; Norway; Reproduction; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Barents Sea; Boreogadus; Gadus morhua; arctic environment; climate effect; demography; gadoid; harvesting; population distribution; spawning; spawning ground; animal; animal dispersal; Atlantic cod; Atlantic Ocean; climate change; economics; fishery; genetics; Norway; physiology; reproduction,,,,,"Aqua Genome Project, (221734/O30); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; FISHCOM, (280467); Institute of Marine Research; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (675997); Norges Forskningsråd, (243892, 244647/E10)","Funding text 1: The Research Council of Norway supported this work through the projects: SUSTAIN (244647/E10), Seasurf (243892), The Aqua Genome Project (221734/O30), and FISHCOM (280467).

Melatonin concentrations were significantly lowered under nocturnal white light already at 1 lx. Low intensity blue, green and red ALAN lowered the melatonin levels significantly in comparison to a dark control. We conclude that ALAN can disturb melatonin rhythms in roach at very low intensities and at different wavelengths and thus light pollution in urban waters has the potential to impact biological rhythms in fish. However, mRNA expression of gonadotropins was not affected by ALAN during the period of the experiments. Thus, suspected implications of ALAN on reproduction of roach could not be substantiated. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biological rhythms; Fish; Light colour; Light intensity; Light pollution; Reproduction,"Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Cyprinidae; Gene Expression Regulation; Gonadotropins; Light; Melatonin; RNA, Messenger; gonadotropin; melatonin; messenger RNA; animal; circadian rhythm; Cyprinidae; gene expression regulation; genetics; light; metabolism; physiology; radiation response",,"gonadotropin, 63231-54-9; melatonin, 73-31-4; Gonadotropins, ; Melatonin, ; RNA, Messenger, ",,,"Verlust der Nacht; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (BMBF-033L038A)","Acknowledgements The authors like to thank Matthias Kunow and students at Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries for technical support.

Although this crucial role of nutrient availability in regulating ecosystem structure and functioning has been widely acknowledged, nutrients are still often neglected in observational and experimental synthesis studies due to difficulties in comparing the nutrient status across sites. In the current study, we explain different nutrient-related concepts and discuss the potential of soil-, plant- and remote sensing-based metrics to compare the nutrient status across space. Based on our review and additional analyses on a dataset of European, managed temperate and boreal forests (ICP [International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests] Forests dataset), we conclude that the use of plant- and remote sensing-based metrics that rely on tissue stoichiometry is limited due to their strong dependence on species identity. The potential use of other plant-based metrics such as Ellenberg indicator values and plant-functional traits is also discussed. We conclude from our analyses and review that soil-based metrics have the highest potential for successful intersite comparison of the nutrient status. As an example, we used and adjusted a soil-based metric, previously developed for conifer forests across Sweden, against the same ICP Forests data. We suggest that this adjusted and further adaptable metric, which included the organic carbon concentration in the upper 20 cm of the soil (including the organic fermentation-humus [FH] layer), the C:N ratio and pHCaCl2 of the FH layer, can be used as a complementary tool along with other indicators of nutrient availability, to compare the background nutrient status across temperate and boreal forests dominated by spruce, pine or beech. Future collection and provision of harmonized soil data from observational and experimental sites is crucial for further testing and adjusting the metric. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ICP Forests; leaf economics spectrum; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; nutrient status; plant functional traits; remote sensing; soil nutrients; stoichiometry; tree growth,Benchmarking; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Soil; Sweden; Trees; Sweden; Coniferophyta; Fagus; Picea; nitrogen; boreal forest; comparative study; growth rate; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; remote sensing; soil nutrient; stoichiometry; temperate forest; tree; benchmarking; ecosystem; forest; soil; Sweden; tree,,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Nitrogen, ; Soil, ",,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (610028); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (MDM-2015-0552); European Commission, EC, (09-01-2019); European Research Council, ERC, (ERC-SyG-2013 IMBALANCE-P); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; Naturvårdsverket, NVV","The evaluation of the European forest nutrient status was based on data collected by partners of the official UNECE ICP Forests Network (http://icp-forests.net/contributors).

Numerous species exhibit daily cycles or strong scototaxic behaviours that could potentially be influenced if natural lighting conditions or cycles are disrupted. Artificial Light Pollution at Night (ALAN) stands for situations where artificial light alters natural light-dark cycles, as well as light intensities and wavelengths. ALAN is increasingly recognized as a potential threat to biodiversity, mainly because a growing number of studies are demonstrating its influence on animal behaviour, migration, reproduction and biological interactions. Most of these studies have focused on terrestrial organisms and ecosystems with studies on the effects of ALAN on marine ecosystems being more occasional. However, with the increasing human use and development of the coastal zone, organisms that inhabit shallow coastal or intertidal systems could be at increasing risk from ALAN. In this study we measured the levels of artificial light intensity in the field and used these levels to conduct experimental trials to determine the impact of ALAN on an intertidal fish. Specifically, we measured ALAN effects on physiological performance (oxygen consumption) and behaviour (activity patterns) of “Baunco” the rockfish Girella laevifrons, one of the most abundant and ecologically important intertidal fish in the Southeastern Pacific littoral. Our results indicated that individuals exposed to ALAN exhibited increased oxygen consumption and activity when compared with control animals. Moreover, those fish exposed to ALAN stopped displaying the natural (circatidal and circadian) activity cycles that were observed in control fish throughout the experiment. These changes in physiological function and behaviour could have serious implications for the long-term sustainability of fish populations and indirect impacts on intertidal communities in areas affected by ALAN. © 2018",ALAN; Artificial light pollution; Endogenous activity; Intertidal fish,"Activity Cycles; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Environmental Pollution; Fishes; Humans; Lighting; Oxygen Consumption; Photoperiod; Reproduction; Seafood; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast); Animalia; Girella laevifrons; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Oxygen; Physiology; Pollution; oxygen; ALAN; Artificial light; Biological interactions; Experimental trials; Intertidal communities; Long-term sustainability; Physiological functions; Terrestrial organisms; behavioral response; intertidal environment; light pollution; marine ecosystem; perciform; physiological response; pollution effect; pollution exposure; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; biodiversity; controlled study; energy expenditure; fish; Girella laevifrons; light dark cycle; light intensity; light pollution; littoral; night; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; periodicity; physiology; terrestrial species; animal; ecosystem; energy metabolism; human; illumination; photoperiodicity; physiology; pollution; reproduction; sea food; Fish",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,"ICM MINECON; MUSELS; Millennium Nucleus Center for the Study of Multiple-Drivers on Marine Socio-ecological Systems; Universidad Andres Bello, (DI 16-18/R); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT, (1171056); University of Prince Edward Island, UPEI; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica, FONDECYT","Funding text 1: We thank to two anonymous reviewers for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Increasing development of shoreline habitats leads to increased light pollution (e.g., from cottages, docks, automobile traffic), which could impact the ecology of littoral zones of lakes and rivers. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) engage in sole paternal care, guarding their nest continually, day and night, to protect their developing offspring. Any alterations to their behaviour—either directly because of the response to light or indirectly due to changes in nest predator activity and associated response of the bass—could lead to increased energetic demands for fish that have a fixed energy budget and ultimately reduce reproductive success. To examine this issue, tri-axial accelerometer biologgers were externally attached to nesting smallmouth bass during the egg stage to determine whether light pollution (i.e., dock lights with low levels of continuous light and spotlights with high intensity irregular light simulating automobile traffic) altered behaviour of nesting males relative to control fish. Our study revealed that both types of light pollution increased overall bass activity level compared with the control group. The intermittent light treatment group had the highest activity and exhibited large fluctuations between night and day activity levels. Fish in the continual light treatment group displayed statistically higher activity than the control fish but showed limited fluctuations between day and night activity levels. Our results suggest that continuous or intermittent light sources, common in shoreline habitats that have been developed, have the potential to alter the behaviour and thus energy use of nest-guarding fish. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the ecological consequences of light pollution in aquatic ecosystems. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Behavioural alteration; Light pollution; Smallmouth bass,Micropterus dolomieu; Rumex; Teleostei; Aquatic ecosystems; Budget control; Docks; Fish; Hydraulic structures; Light sources; River pollution; Speed control; Automobile traffic; Behavioural alteration; Ecological consequences; Intermittent light; Light pollution; Reproductive success; Smallmouth bass; Triaxial accelerometer; activity pattern; behavioral response; ecological impact; intertidal environment; light pollution; parental care; pollution effect; reproductive success; teleost; animal experiment; Article; behavior change; controlled study; cosmological phenomena; day; energy transfer; habitat; intertidal zone; light intensity; light pollution; male; male animal; Micropterus; Micropterus dolomieu; nesting; night; nonhuman; parental behavior; traffic; Pollution control,,,,,,,"Ali M.A., The ocular structure, retinomotor and photo-behavioral responses of juvenile pacific salmon, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 37, pp. 965-996, (1959); Becker A., Whitfield A.K., Cowley P.D., Jarnegren J., Naesje T.F., Does boat traffic cause displacement of fish in estuaries?, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 75, pp. 168-173, (2013); Brown T.G., Runciman B., Pollard S., Grant A.D.A., Bradford M.J., Biological Synopsis of Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu).

Box 94, Grahamstown, 6140, South Africa","Artificial lights may be altering interactions between bats and moth prey. According to the allotonic frequency hypothesis (AFH), eared moths are generally unavailable as prey for syntonic bats (i.e., bats that use echolocation frequencies between 20 and 50 kHz within the hearing range of eared moths) due to the moths’ ability to detect syntonic bat echolocation. Syntonic bats therefore feed mainly on beetles, flies, true bugs, and non-eared moths. The AFH is expected to be violated around lights where eared moths are susceptible to exploitation by syntonic bats because moths’ evasive strategies become less effective. The hypothesis has been tested to date almost exclusively in areas with permanent lighting, where the effects of lights on bat diets are confounded with other aspects of human habitat alteration. We undertook diet analysis in areas with short-term, localized artificial lighting to isolate the effects of artificial lighting and determine if syntonic and allotonic bats (i.e., bats that use echolocation frequencies outside the hearing range of eared moths) consumed more moths under conditions of artificial lights than in natural darkness. We found that syntonic bats increased their consumption of moth prey under experimentally lit conditions, likely owing to a reduction in the ability of eared moths to evade the bats. Eared moths may increase in diets of generalist syntonic bats foraging around artificial light sources, as opposed to allotonic species and syntonic species with a more specialized diet. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Allotonic; Bat diets; Light pollution; Syntonic; Tympanate insects,Animals; Chiroptera; Diet; Echolocation; Hearing; Moths; Predatory Behavior; Coleoptera; Heteroptera; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; diet; echolocation; experimental study; frequency analysis; habitat structure; hypothesis testing; insect; light pollution; moth; pollution effect; prey selection; animal; bat; diet; echolocation; hearing; moth; predation,,,,,"National Research Foundation Thuthuka, (106958); RMB; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding Research funding was provided by the National Research Foundation Thuthuka Grant (Grant no. 106958 [BS]) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada (RMB).","Acharya L., Fenton M.B., Bat attacks and moth defensive behaviour around streetlights, Can J Zool, 77, pp. 27-33, (1999); Buchler E.R., Food transit time in Myotis lucifugus Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae, J Mammal, 56, pp. 252-255, (1975); Burles D.W., Brigham R.M., Ring R.A., Reimchen T.E., Diet of two insectivorous bats, Myotis lucifugus and Myotis keenii, in relation to arthropod abundance in a temperate Pacific Northwest rainforest environment, Can J Zool, 86, pp. 1367-1375, (2008); Clare E.L., Symondson W.O.C., Fenton B., An inordinate fondness for beetles?

Experiments and within-species comparisons suggest that environmental temperature might be important in explaining this variation. To investigate the importance of temperature, at broad geographical and taxonomic scales, we extended a global database of terrestrial arthropods screened for Wolbachia and Cardinium. Our final dataset contained data from more than 117 000 arthropods (over 2500 species) screened for Wolbachia and more than 18 000 arthropods (over 800 species) screened for Cardinium, including samples from 137 different countries, with mean temperatures varying from −6.5 to 29.2°C. In insects and relatives, Cardinium infection showed a clear and consistent tendency to increase with temperature. For Wolbachia, a tendency to increase with temperature in temperate climates is counteracted by reduced prevalence in the tropics, resulting in a weak negative trend overall. We discuss the implications of these results for natural and introduced symbionts in regions affected by climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

The present study on Indian weaver bird (Ploceus philippinus) investigated if exposure to bright light at different phases of night affects their clock-mediated daily functions. Birds were placed individually in specially designed activity cages under short days and long nights (8L:16D; L = 100 lux, D < 0.1 lux) for ∼3 weeks (19 days). Thereafter, they were divided into four groups (n = 6–9), and given ∼2 lux light either for the entire night (ZT 08–24; zeitgeber time 0 = time of light on; pattern A) or for 4 hr (pattern B), placed in 16 hr night such that its onset coincides with the onset of night (early night group, ZT 08–12), its end with the end of night (late night group, ZT 20–24), or the night was interrupted in the middle (midnight group, ZT 14–18). The results showed that bright light in entire night induced early onset of day activity and fragmented rest at night, however, if given at different phases of night, it made the days longer by delaying end (early night group) or advancing onset of daily activity (late night group). It also suppressed the melatonin levels and increased body temperature. These results suggest that bright light at night alters the perception of daylength and affects the underlying physiology. The findings may be useful in adopting a strategy for use of night light without disturbing species fitness in their environment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",bright light at night; locomotor activity; melatonin; temperature; weaver bird,Animals; Body Temperature; Light; Lighting; Locomotion; Melatonin; Passeriformes; Photoperiod; Seasons; melatonin; animal; blood; body temperature; illumination; light; locomotion; Passeriformes; photoperiodicity; physiology; radiation response; season,,"melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ",,,"Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology; Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India, (BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012); University Grants Commission, UGC, (201112-RGNF-SC-UTT-11960)","Funding text 1: Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: BT/PR4984/MED/30/752/2012; University Grants Commission, Grant/Award Number: 201112-RGNF-SC-UTT-11960; Funding text 2: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions to help us improve quality of the manuscript.

So far the spatiotemporal pattern in tree resilience in the Tibetan Plateau remains largely unquantified and the influence of specific factors on the resilience is poorly understood. Here, we study ring-width data from 849 trees at 28 sites in the Tibetan Plateau with the aim to quantify tree resilience and determine their diving forces. Three extreme drought events in years 1969, 1979, and 1995 are detected from metrological records. Regional tree resistance to the three extreme droughts shows a decreasing trend with the proportion of trees having high resistance ranging from 71.9%, 55.2%, to 39.7%. Regional tree recovery is increasing with the proportion of trees having high recovery ranging from 28.3%, 52.2%, to 64.2%. The area with high resistance is contracting and that of high recovery is expanding. The spatiotemporal resistance and recovery are associated with moisture availability and diurnal temperature range, respectively. In addition, they are both associated with forest internal factor represented by growth consistence among trees. We conclude that juniper trees in the Tibetan Plateau have increased resilience to extreme droughts in the study period. We highlight pervasive resilience in juniper trees. The results have implications for predicting tree resilience and identifying areas vulnerable to future climate extremes. © 2018 The Authors Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; extreme drought; recovery; resistance; spatial resilience; tree rings,"Climate Change; Droughts; Forests; Juniperus; Tibet; Trees; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Juniperus; climate change; coniferous tree; drought; ecosystem resilience; extreme event; tree ring; climate change; drought; forest; growth, development and aging; Juniperus; Tibet; tree",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31330015)",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China project No. 31330015.

The potential physiological costs of this night lighting are often evident in life history shifts. We investigated the effects of chronic night-Time exposure to ecologically relevant levels of LED lighting on the life history traits of the nocturnal Australian garden orb-web spider (Eriophora biapicata). We reared spiders under a 12-h day and either a 12-h natural darkness (∼0 lux) or a 12-h dim light (∼20 lux) night and assessed juvenile development, growth and mortality, and adult reproductive success and survival. We found that exposure to ALAN accelerated juvenile development, resulting in spiders progressing through fewer moults, and maturing earlier and at a smaller size. There was a significant increase in daily juvenile mortality for spiders reared under 20 lux, but the earlier maturation resulted in a comparable number of 0 lux and 20 lux spiders reaching maturity. Exposure to ALAN also considerably reduced the number of eggs produced by females, and this was largely associated with ALAN-induced reductions in body size. Despite previous observations of increased fitness for some orb-web spiders in urban areas and near night lighting, it appears that exposure to artificial night lighting may lead to considerable developmental costs. Future research will need to consider the detrimental effects of ALAN combined with foraging benefits when studying nocturnal insectivores that forage around artificial lights. © Copyright 2018 Willmott et al.",Artificial light at night; Development; Life history; Orb-web spider; Urbanisation,adult; article; body size; darkness; female; forage; foraging; illumination; insectivore; juvenile; life history trait; light; maturity; mortality; night; nonhuman; reproductive success; spider; survival; urban area; urbanization,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP150101191); Hermon Slade Foundation, (HSF 14/4)","This research was supported by a grant from the Hermon Slade Foundation awarded to Therésa Jones (HSF 14/4) and an Australian Research Council grant to Therésa Jones (DP150101191).

There is growing concern that because of the disruption of natural light cycles, ALAN may pose serious risks for wildlife. While ALAN has been shown to affect many aspects of animal behaviour and physiology, few studies have experimentally studied whether individuals of different species in the wild respond differently to ALAN. Here, we investigated the effect of ALAN on sleep behaviour in two closely related songbird species inhabiting the same study area and roosting/breeding in similar nest boxes. We experimentally exposed free-living great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) to artificial light inside their nest boxes and observed changes in their sleep behaviour compared to the previous night when the nest boxes were dark. In line with previous studies, sleep behaviour of both species did not differ under dark conditions. ALAN disrupted sleep in both great and blue tits. However, compared to blue tits, great tits showed more pronounced effects and more aspects of sleep were affected. Light exposed great tits entered the nest boxes and fell asleep later, woke up and exited the nest boxes earlier, and the total sleep amount and sleep percentage were reduced. By contrast, these changes in sleep behaviour were not found in light exposed blue tits. Our field experiment, using exactly the same light manipulation in both species, provides direct evidence that two closely related species respond differently to ALAN, while their sleep behaviour under dark conditions was similar. Our research suggests that findings for one species cannot necessarily be generalised to other species, even closely-related species. Furthermore, species-specific effects could have implications for community dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial light at night; Blue tits; Great tits; Light pollution; Sleep behaviour; Species-specific,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Breeding; Environmental Pollution; Light; Passeriformes; Photoperiod; Sleep; Songbirds; Animalia; Cyanistes caeruleus; Parus major; Passeri; Behavioral research; Birds; Pollution; Artificial light; Blue tits; Great tit; Light pollution; Sleep behaviour; Species specifics; behavioral response; community dynamics; light effect; light pollution; physiology; sleep; songbird; behavior; breeding; community dynamics; Cyanistes caeruleus; field experiment; human; light pollution; night; nonhuman; Parus major; sleep; analysis; animal; animal behavior; light; Passeriformes; photoperiodicity; physiology; pollution; sleep; songbird; statistics and numerical data; Sleep research",,,,,"FWO-project, (1104415N, 1104417N, G052117N, G0A3615N); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; Universiteit Antwerpen","This study was supported by the University of Antwerp and the FWO Flanders through a FWO-project (to RP and ME, project ID: G0A3615N and G052117N ) and a PhD fellowship (to TR, grant ID: 1104415N and 1104417N).

Furthermore, most climate change adaptation efforts emphasize where to implement management actions, whereas timing remains largely overlooked. The rate of modern climate change introduces urgency in evaluating whether delaying conservation actions compromises their efficacy for reaching important conservation targets. We evaluated the importance of multiple climate change adaptation strategies including timing of actions on preventing extinctions for a threatened climate-sensitive species, the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus). We parameterized a range-wide population viability analysis model that related demographic sensitivities to drought events and human-modified land cover to assess vulnerability to future climate change. Using simulations, we assessed the efficacy and trade-offs associated with alternative climate adaptation strategies aimed at maximizing the number of future populations including when to initiate conservation actions, duration of management, number of managed populations, and local management effectiveness. Population-level projections under future climate change scenarios revealed a broad-scale pattern of range contraction in the southwestern portion of the current range. Along the extinction gradient, we identified demographic strongholds and refugia critical for population persistence under climate change as well as populations at high risk of extinction and candidates for climate change adaptation actions. In the context of future climate change, the timing of conservation actions was crucial; acting earlier maximized chances of achieving conservation targets. Even considering uncertainty in climate change projections, delaying actions was less efficient and introduced undesirable trade-offs including the need to implement conservation actions for longer or targeting more populations to achieve a similar conservation target. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight how acting quickly reduces risk and improves outcomes for a highly vulnerable species under future climate change. Climate change vulnerability assessments require translation of model-based outputs into tractable information for climate change adaptation planning. Quantifying trade-offs associated with the multidimensional decision space related to species conservation and recovery planning is a critical step in climate change adaptation. © 2018 The Authors.

We manipulated the night environment and examined cellular and molecular changes in hippocampus, the brain region involved in cognition and mood, of Indian house crows (Corvus splendens) exposed to 12 hr light (150 lux): 12 hr darkness (0 lux). Diurnal corvids are an ideal model species with cognitive abilities at par with mammals. Dim light (6 lux) at night (dLAN) altered daily activity:rest pattern, reduced sleep, and induced depressive-like responses (decreased eating and self-grooming, self-mutilation, and reduced novel object exploration); return to an absolute dark night reversed these negative effects. dLAN suppressed nocturnal melatonin levels; however, diurnal corticosterone levels were unaffected. Concomitant reduction of immunoreactivity for DCX and BDNF suggested dLAN-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and compromised neuronal health. dLAN also negatively influenced hippocampal expression of genes associated with depressive-like responses (bdnf, il-1β, tnfr1, nr4a2), but not of those associated with neuronal plasticity (egr1, creb, syngap, syn2, grin2a, grin2b), cellular oxidative stress (gst, sod3, cat1) and neuronal death (caspase2, caspase3, foxo3). Furthermore, we envisaged the role of BDNF and showed epigenetic modification of bdnf gene by decreased histone H3 acetylation and increased hdac4 expression under dLAN. These results demonstrate transcriptional and epigenetic bases of dLAN-induced negative effects in diurnal crows, and provide insights into the risks of exposure to illuminated nights to animals including humans in an urban setting. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",corvid; depressive-like response; dLAN; mood; sleep,Animals; Biomarkers; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Circadian Rhythm; Corticosterone; Crows; Depression; Gene Expression; Hippocampus; Lighting; Melatonin; Photoperiod; biological marker; brain derived neurotrophic factor; corticosterone; melatonin; adverse event; animal; biosynthesis; blood; circadian rhythm; Corvus; depression; gene expression; genetics; hippocampus; illumination; metabolism; photoperiodicity; physiology,,"brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; corticosterone, 50-22-6; melatonin, 73-31-4; Biomarkers, ; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, ; Corticosterone, ; Melatonin, ",,,"University Grants Commission, UGC; Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala; University of Delhi, DU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a grant from the Department of Science and Technology under its Cognitive Science Initiative and DU PURSE program, University of Delhi under its R&D Program.; Funding text 2: Department of Science and Technology under its Cognitive Science Initiative and DU PURSE program, University of Delhi under its R&D Program.

To test this, we conducted two types of experiment. First, we assessed the reaction distance and swimming speed of juvenile rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) allowed to forage on juvenile Daphnia pulex × pulicaria under three artificial light sources: halogen, high pressure sodium (HPS), and metal halide bulbs, at the same light intensity. Second, we assessed the evasiveness of D. pulex × pulicaria under the same artificial light sources and in darkness (as a control), in the presence and absence of chemical information on predation risk (kairomones) of juvenile rudd. We found that while both reaction distance and swimming speed of fish was greater under halogen compared to HPS, and similar under metal halide light compared to halogen and HPS, the evasiveness of Daphnia was greater under halogen and HPS-generated light than under metal halide light. The results suggest a possible mismatch of Daphnia’s behavioural response under metal halide light to predicted predation risk, and thus a possible threat to predator–prey balance in a lake ecosystem. © 2018, The Author(s).",Artificial light at night; Evasiveness; Fish kairomones; Predation risk; Reaction distance; Swimming speed,Daphnia; Daphnia pulex-pulicaria; Scardinius erythrophthalmus; fish; lake ecosystem; light effect; mortality risk; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; prey selection; swimming behavior,,,,,"Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2014/13/B/NZ8/04670, 2014/13/N/NZ8/02462, 2016/21/N/NZ8/00914); Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW; Uniwersytet Warszawski, UW, (DSM 501/86-1126038); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","We would like to thank T.

Marine environments are subjected to artifcial lighting from coastal development, in addition to ofshore sources, such as fshing vessels, oil platforms and cruise ships. Fish species that rely on nearshore habitats are most signifcantly impacted by coastal light pollution, as they are often limited to nearshore habitats due to predation risk in deeper ofshore waters, particularly as juveniles. Juvenile bonefsh [Albula vulpes (Linnaeus, 1758)] inhabit the nearshore environment, and are therefore exposed to coastal lighting and other watershed development impacts. Here, we assessed juvenile bonefsh behavior and physiology in the presence of two common light sources: constant street lighting (high pressure sodium) and intermittent car headlights (H4 halogen). Te behavioral responses were compared with a night and day control, whereas physiology was compared only with a night control. Each behavioral trial had two time periods: light and recovery (2 hrs each). Physiology (blood glucose and whole body cortisol) was assessed after an overnight 8-hr exposure. Te results suggest that there is no effect of light pollution on the swimming behavior or whole body cortisol of juvenile bonefsh, but that both forms of light pollution resulted in elevated blood glucose concentrations (a simple stress indicator) relative to controls, with constant light glucose levels being signifcantly higher. Further research is needed to understand the ecological consequences of light pollution on bonefsh and other coastal marine fsh using additional endpoints, assessing fsh over longer time periods, and ideally combining data from the laboratory and the feld. © 2017 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",,Albula vulpes;

Previous work showed that several songbird species initiated dawn song earlier in areas with light pollution. However, the mechanisms underlying this shift are still unknown. Individuals may immediately adjust their timing of singing to the presence of artificial light (behavioural plasticity), but the observed effect may also be due to phenotype-dependent habitat choice, effects of conditions during early life or micro-evolution. The main aim of this study was to experimentally investigate how males of four common passerine species respond to day-to-day variation in the presence of artificial night lighting in terms of the timing of singing. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we manipulated the presence of light throughout the night in a cyclic fashion in several naturally undisturbed forest patches. We show that individuals of all four species immediately and reversibly adjusted their onset of dawn singing in response to artificial light. The effect was strongest in the European robin, but relatively small in the blue tit, the great tit and the blackbird. The effect in the latter two species was smaller than expected from the correlational studies. This may be coincidence (small sample size of this study), but it could also indicate that there are longer-term effects of living in light-polluted urban areas on timing of dawn singing, or that birds use compensatory behaviours such as light avoidance. We found no evidence that our light treatment had carryover effects into the subsequent dark period, but robins progressively advanced their dawn singing during the light treatment. © 2016 The Authors.",Cyanistes caeruleus; Dawn chorus; Erithacus rubecula; Light pollution; Parus major; Plasticity; Turdus merula,Aves; Cyanistes caeruleus; Erithacus rubecula; Parus major; Passeri; Passeriformes; Turdus merula; behavioral response; circadian rhythm; experimental study; habitat selection; light effect; light pollution; long-term change; nightglow; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; song; urban area,,,,,"Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We thank Alexia Mouchet, Birgit Egen and Sebastian Gwinner for logistical help and discussions about the experiment, Norbert Haimerl and Agnes Türk for help with setting up the light equipment, David Méndez Diez and Joa Ahern-Seronde for help with the song analyses, and Emmi Schlicht, Marie Herberstein and four anonymous referees for constructive comments on the manuscript.

Each church was also classified according to the presence and amount of aesthetic directional lights (flood-lights) aimed on its walls and tower from the outside. Sixty-one of the churches had previously been surveyed by one of us (J.R.) between 1980 and 1990, before lights were installed on Swedish churches, using the same methods. Churches with bat colonies had decreased significantly in frequency from 61% in 1980s to 38% by 2016. All abandoned churches had been fitted with flood-lights in the period between the two surveys. The loss of bat colonies from lit churches was highly significant and most obvious when lights were applied from all directions, leaving no dark corridor for the bats to leave and return to the roost. In contrast, in churches that were not lit, all of 13 bat colonies remained after 25+ years between the surveys. Lighting of churches and other historical buildings is a serious threat to the long-term survival and reproduction of light-averse bats such as Plecotus spp. and other slow-flying species. Bat roosts are strictly protected according to the EU Habitats Directive and the EUROBATS agreement. Lighting of buildings for aesthetic purposes is becoming a serious environmental issue, because important bat roosts are destroyed in large numbers, and the problem should be handled accordingly. As a start, installation of flood-lights on historical buildings should at least require an environmental impact assessment (EIA). © 2017 The Authors.",Biodiversity; Cultural heritage; Energy; Global change; Historic buildings; Light pollution,,,,,,,,"Rich C., Longcore T., Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting, (2006); Stone E.L., Harris S., Jones G., Impacts of artificial lighting on bats: A review of challenges and solutions, Mamm.

Processes that alter these fluxes may therefore change the diet and composition of consumer communities. We used stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analyses to test whether the increased abundance of aquatic prey observed in a previous study led to a dietary shift in riparian consumers in areas illuminated by artificial light at night (ALAN). We measured the contribution of aquatic-derived carbon to diets in riparian arthropods in experimentally lit and unlit sites along an agricultural drainage ditch in northern Germany. The δ13C signature of the spider Pachygnatha clercki (Tetragnathidae) was 0.7‰ lower in the ALAN-illuminated site in summer, indicating a greater assimilation of aquatic prey. Bayesian mixing models also supported higher intake of aquatic prey under ALAN in spring (34% versus 21%). In contrast, isotopic signatures for P. clercki (0.3‰) and Pardosa prativaga (0.7‰) indicated a preference for terrestrial prey in the illuminated site in spring. Terrestrial prey intake increased in spring for P. clercki under ALAN (from 70% to 74%) and in spring and autumn for P. prativaga (from 68% to 77% and from 67% to 72%) and Opiliones (from 68% to 72%; 68% to 75%). This was despite most of the available prey (up to 80%) being aquatic in origin. We conclude that ALAN changed the diet of riparian secondary consumers by increasing the density of both aquatic and terrestrial prey. Dietary changes were species- and season-specific, indicating that the effects of ALAN may interact with phenology and feeding strategy. Because streetlights can occur in high density near freshwaters, ALAN may have widespread effects on aquatic–terrestrial ecosystem linkages. © 2017 The Authors",ALAN; feeding strategies; food web; predator–prey; SIAR; spiders; stable isotopes,Germany; Araneae; Arthropoda; Opiliones; Pachygnatha; Pardosa prativaga; Tetragnathidae; aquatic ecosystem; arthropod; carbon flux; diet; dietary shift; experimental study; feeding behavior; food web; nocturnal activity; nutrient dynamics; phenology; predator; predator-prey interaction; prey availability; riparian zone; scavenger; spider; stable isotope; terrestrial ecosystem,,,,,"Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Commission; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research; Academy of Finland, AKA, (296918); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (BMBF-033L038A); Bundesamt für Naturschutz, BfN, (FKZ 3514821700); Deutsches Zentrum für integrative Biodiversitätsforschung Halle-Jena-Leipzig, iDiv","Acknowledgements – We thank Stefan Heller, Maja Grubisic, Sibylle Schroer, Liliana Lehmann and Babette Pohlmann for help during the experiment and in the laboratory analysis.

This study compares experimental measurements of the net global warming impact of a rainfed versus a groundwater-irrigated corn (maize)–soybean–wheat, no-till cropping system in the Midwest US, the region that produces the majority of U.S. corn and soybean. Irrigation significantly increased soil organic carbon (C) storage in the upper 25 cm, but not by enough to make up for the CO2-equivalent (CO2e) costs of fossil fuel power, soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), and degassing of supersaturated CO2 and N2O from the groundwater. A rainfed reference system had a net mitigating effect of −13.9 (±31) g CO2e m−2 year−1, but with irrigation at an average rate for the region, the irrigated system contributed to global warming with net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 27.1 (±32) g CO2e m−2 year−1. Compared to the rainfed system, the irrigated system had 45% more GHG emissions and 7% more C sequestration. The irrigation-associated increase in soil N2O and fossil fuel emissions contributed 18% and 9%, respectively, to the system's total emissions in an average irrigation year. Groundwater degassing of CO2 and N2O are missing components of previous assessments of the GHG cost of groundwater irrigation; together they were 4% of the irrigated system's total emissions. The irrigated system's net impact normalized by crop yield (GHG intensity) was +0.04 (±0.006) kg CO2e kg−1 yield, close to that of the rainfed system, which was −0.03 (±0.002) kg CO2e kg−1 yield. Thus, the increased crop yield resulting from irrigation can ameliorate overall GHG emissions if intensification by irrigation prevents land conversion emissions elsewhere, although the expansion of irrigation risks depletion of local water resources. © 2018 The Authors.

Increased human activities such as tourism and artificial lights on the coasts, however, have interfered with the ability of sea turtle neonates to find their correct destination, negatively affecting their survival rates. Here we endeavored to assess the influence of artificial lights on the hatchlings of the sea turtle Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnaeus, 1766) in the south coast of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. To that end, 10 experiments were conducted with 15 hatchlings/test subjects. Five experiments took place in artificially illuminated areas and five in non-illuminated areas. Circles with a 2 m radius were drawn on the sand a small 2-3 cm depression was made at the center of each circles. The neonates were then placed in the depressions to simulate their coming from a nest. After the neonates crossed the edge of the circles, their tracks were photographed and drawn on a diagram. To ascertain if the trajectories of the neonates differed between the two groups (hatchlings from illuminated versus non-illuminated nests), the Rayleigh test was used. The significance of those differences was tested using ANOVA. To evaluate similarities and significance of clusters, a Multi-Dimensional Scaling was used. The tracks of 86.67% (N = 65) of the hatchlings from nests at illuminated areas departed from their correct trajectory. The distribution of trajectories was considered random (V = 19.4895, p > 0.05) only for tracks originating from artificially illuminated areas. The movement patterns of hatchlings from illuminated and non-illuminated areas differed significantly (F < 0.0001, p < 0.01). Consistent with this, two distinct groups were identified, one from illuminated and one from non-illuminated areas. Therefore, we conclude that artificial illumination impacts the orientation of hawksbill hatchlings. This suggests that in order to protect this species it is necessary to safeguard its nesting areas from artificial lights. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

To further our understanding of the impacts of ALAN on marine organisms, this study examines how the reproductive fitness of the common clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris is influenced by the presence of ALAN. We assessed how exposure to low levels of ALAN affects (i) frequency of spawning, (ii) egg fertilization success, and (iii) hatching success of A. ocellaris under control (12 : 12 day-night) and treatment (12 : 12 day-ALAN) light regimes. While we found exposure to ALAN had no impact on the frequency of spawning or fertilization success, ALAN had dramatic effects on hatching. Amphiprion ocellaris eggs incubated in the presence of ALAN simply did not hatch, resulting in zero survivorship of offspring. These findings suggest ALAN can significantly reduce reproductive fitness in a benthic-spawning reef fish. Further research in this field is necessary to fully understand the extent of this impact on population and community dynamics in the wild. © 2019 The Author(s).",Amphiprion ocellaris; Anthropogenic disturbance; Light pollution; Reproductive fitness; Spawning,Animals; Ecosystem; Fishes; Light; Perciformes; Amphiprion ocellaris; anthropogenic effect; aquatic organism; community dynamics; disturbance; fish; fitness; light pollution; marine environment; reproductive success; spawning; terrestrial ecosystem; animal; ecosystem; fish; light; Perciformes,,,,,,,"Gaston K.J., Bennie J., Demographic effects of artificial nighttime lighting on animal populations, Environ.

Natural daylight and moonlight cycles play a fundamental role for many organisms and ecological processes, so an increase in light pollution may have profound effects on communities and ecosystem services. Studies assessing ecological light pollution (ELP) effects on sandy beach organisms have lagged behind the study of other sources of disturbance. Hence, we assessed the influence of this stressor on locomotor activity, foraging behavior, absorption efficiency and growth rate of adults of the talitrid amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata. In the field, an artificial light system was assembled to assess the local influence of artificial light conditions on the amphipod's locomotor activity and use of food patches in comparison to natural (ambient) conditions. Meanwhile in the laboratory, two experimental chambers were set to assess amphipod locomotor activity, consumption rates, absorption efficiency and growth under artificial light in comparison to natural light-dark cycles. Our results indicate that artificial light have significantly adverse effects on the activity patterns and foraging behavior of the amphipods, resulting on reduced consumption and growth rates. Given the steady increase in artificial light pollution here and elsewhere, sandy beach communities could be negatively affected, with unexpected consequences for the whole ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Amphipods; Light pollution; Sandy beach,Amphipoda; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Light; Lighting; Amphipoda; Invertebrata; Orchestoidea tuberculata; Talitridae; Beaches; Ecology; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Food supply; Growth rate; Absorption efficiency; Amphipods; Ecological process; Ecosystem services; Foraging behaviors; Light pollution; Locomotor activity; Sandy beach; amphipod; food consumption; growth rate; invertebrate; light pollution; pollution effect; adult; Amphipoda; ecosystem; food intake; foraging behavior; growth rate; human; light dark cycle; light pollution; locomotion; nonhuman; seashore; Amphipoda; animal; feeding behavior; illumination; light; pollution; radiation response; Pollution,,,,,"MINECON, (NC120086); Millennium Nucleus Center for the Study of Multiple-Drivers on Marine Socio-ecological Systems; Universidad Andres Bello, (302-13); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; University of Prince Edward Island, UPEI; Dirección General de Investigación Científica y Técnica, DGICT","The authors are grateful of Francesca Carrion and Nicole Zúñiga for their valuable assistance during the experiments.

The community-level effects of existing street lights on moths and their biotic interactions have not previously been studied. Using a combination of sampling methods at matched-pairs of lit and unlit sites, we found significant effects of street lighting: moth abundance at ground level was halved at lit sites, species richness was >25% lower, and flight activity at the level of the light was 70% greater. Furthermore, we found that 23% of moths carried pollen of at least 28 plant species and that there was a consequent overall reduction in pollen transport at lit sites. These findings support the disruptive impact of lights on moth activity, which is one proposed mechanism driving moth declines, and suggest that street lighting potentially impacts upon pollination by nocturnal invertebrates. We highlight the importance of considering both direct and cascading impacts of artificial light. © 2016 The Authors.

Such events may cause ecosystem reconfigurations arising from species range contraction or redistribution, with ecological, economic and social implications. Macrophytes such as the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus and the seagrass Zostera marina are foundation species in many coastal ecosystems of the temperate northern hemisphere. Hence, their response to extreme events can potentially determine the fate of associated ecosystems. Macrophyte functioning is intimately linked to the maintenance of photosynthesis, growth and reproduction, and resistance against pathogens, epibionts and grazers. We investigated morphological, physiological, pathological and chemical defence responses of western Baltic Sea F. vesiculosus and Z. marina populations to simulated near-natural marine heatwaves. Along with (a) the control, which constituted no heatwave but natural stochastic temperature variability (0HW), two treatments were applied: (b) two late-spring heatwaves (June, July) followed by a summer heatwave (August; 3HW) and (c) a summer heatwave only (1HW). The 3HW treatment was applied to test whether preconditioning events can modulate the potential sensitivity to the summer heatwave. Despite the variety of responses measured in both species, only Z. marina growth was impaired by the accumulative heat stress imposed by the 3HW treatment. Photosynthetic rate, however, remained high after the last heatwave indicating potential for recovery. Only epibacterial abundance was significantly affected in F. vesiculosus. Hence both macrophytes, and in particular F. vesiculosus, seem to be fairly tolerant to short-term marine heatwaves at least at the intensities applied in this experiment (up to 5°C above mean temperature over a period of 9 days). This may partly be due to the fact that F. vesiculosus grows in a highly variable environment, and may have a high phenotypic plasticity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Baltic Sea; extreme events; foundation species; Fucus; heat stress; macrophytes; marine heatwaves; Zostera,Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fucus; Temperature; Zosteraceae; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Fucus; Fucus vesiculosus; Zostera; Zostera marina; chemical defense; extreme event; heat wave; macrophyte; morphology; pathology; physiological response; seagrass; seaweed; climate change; ecosystem; Fucus; temperature; Zosteraceae,,,,,"GEOMAR; Helmholtz; Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt, DBU; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD, (57129429); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Ministério da Educação, MEC, (99999.001303/2015‐05)","MS was awarded the research grant CP1215 from the DFG Excellence Cluster ‘Future Ocean’ as PI.

Effects of light at night on reproductive fitness traits are demonstrated across taxa however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are largely untested. One possible mechanism is that light at night may result in perturbed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress levels. Here, we reared Drosophila melanogaster under either dim (10 lx) light or no light (0 lx) at night for three generations and then compared mating and lifetime oviposition patterns. In a second experiment, we explored whether exposure to light at night treatments resulted in variation in ROS levels in the heads and ovaries of six, 23- and 36-day-old females. We demonstrate that dim light at night affects mating and reproductive output: 10 lx flies courted for longer prior to mating, and female oviposition patterns differed to 0 lx females. ROS levels were lower in the ovaries but not heads, of 10 lx compared with 0 lx females. We suggest that reduced ROS levels may reflect changes in ovarian physiology and cell signaling, which may be related to the differences observed in oviposition patterns. Taken together, our results indicate negative consequences for invertebrates under more stressful, urban, lit conditions and further investigation into the mechanisms driving these changes is warranted to manage invertebrate communities in a brighter future. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",ALAN; Drosophila melanogaster; light pollution; mating; ovaries; oviposition; reactive oxygen species,"Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Light; Lighting; Male; Ovary; Oviposition; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; Drosophila melanogaster; egg laying; female; illumination; light; male; metabolism; ovary; radiation response; reproduction; sexual behavior",,"Reactive Oxygen Species, ",,,"Hermon Slade Foundation, (HSF-14/4); Monash University, MU","Our appreciation goes to the Jones Laboratory for assistance with fly husbandry, the Green Laboratory for help with the ROS assay, the Plant Cell Biology Research Laboratory for use of their microplate reader and Associate Professor Damian Dowling (Monash University) for ROS assay trials.

Among the ecological effects of ALAN, changes in reproductive timing are frequently reported, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still poorly understood. Here, we experimentally investigated these mechanisms by assessing dose-dependent photoperiodic responses to ALAN in the great tit (Parus major). We individually exposed photosensitive male birds to one of three nocturnal light levels (0.5, 1.5, and 5 lux), or to a dark control. Subsequent histological and molecular analyses on their testes indicated a dose-dependent reproductive response to ALAN. Specifically, different stages of gonadal growth were activated after exposure to different levels of light at night. mRNA transcript levels of genes linked to the development of germ cells (stra8 and spo11) were increased under 0.5 lux compared to the dark control. The 0.5 and 1.5 lux groups showed slight increases in testis size and transcript levels associated with steroid synthesis (lhr and hsd3b1) and spermatogenesis (fshr, wt1, sox9, and cldn11), although spermatogenesis was not detected in histological analysis. In contrast, all birds under 5 lux had 10 to 30 times larger testes than birds in all other groups, with a parallel strong increase in mRNA transcript levels and clear signs of spermatogenesis. Across treatments, the volume of the testes was generally a good predictor of testicular transcript levels. Overall, our findings indicate that even small changes in nocturnal light intensity can increase, or decrease, effects on the reproductive physiology of wild organisms. © The Authors.

The frequency of such ECEs is expected to increase with climate warming, threatening the sustainability of temperate forests. Here, we analyzed 2,844 tree-ring width series of five dominant European tree species from 104 Swiss sites ranging from 400 to 2,200 m a.s.l. for the period 1930–2016. We found that (a) the broadleaved oak and beech are sensitive to late frosts that strongly reduce current year growth; however, tree growth is highly resilient and fully recovers within 2 years; (b) radial growth of the conifers larch and spruce is strongly and enduringly reduced by spring droughts—these species are the least resistant and resilient to droughts; (c) oak, silver fir, and to a lower extent beech, show higher resistance and resilience to spring droughts and seem therefore better adapted to the future climate. Our results allow a robust comparison of the tree growth responses to drought and spring frost across large climatic gradients and provide striking evidence that the growth of some of the most abundant and economically important European tree species will be increasingly limited by climate warming. These results could serve for supporting species selection to maintain the sustainability of forest ecosystem services under the expected increase in ECEs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate warming; climatic water balance; dendrochronology; extreme climatic events; frost risk; growing degree-days; tree phenology; tree-ring width,Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Fagus; Forests; Trees; Europe; Abies; Coniferophyta; Fagus; Larix; Picea; coniferous tree; drought; extreme event; frost; global warming; heat wave; phenology; seasonal variation; tree ring; water budget; beech; climate change; drought; ecosystem; forest; tree,,,,,Marco Vanoni,"This study has been funded by the SwissForestLab.

Commuting and foraging bats have been found to be affected by ALAN, but no study has yet addressed the impact of lighting on drinking activity, despite its critical importance for bats. We experimentally illuminated cattle troughs used by drinking bats at four forest sites in Italy, and compared drinking activity and foraging activity under lit and dark conditions. We predicted that (1) the number of bat species and drinking events will be lower under illumination and (2) forest bat species will be more affected than edge specialists. We recorded 2549 drinking events from 12 species or species groups, most of which decreased drinking activity under illumination. The effects of ALAN on drinking were stronger than on foraging. Forest species never drank when the light was on. Edge-foraging species reduced drinking activity while also increasing foraging under lit conditions. We highlight a previously overlooked negative effect of ALAN on bats, whose implications may be locally catastrophic. Given the importance of water sites for both bat foraging and drinking, their illumination should be forbidden, appropriately mitigated or, if necessary, compensated for with the creation of alternative drinking sites. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London",aquatic habitat; Chiroptera; dehydration; foraging; light pollution; light-emitting diode; ultrasound,Animalia; Bos; Chiroptera; bat; dehydration; drinking; foraging behavior; light effect,,,,,,,"Ancillotto L., Cistrone L., Mosconi F., Jones G., Boitani L., Russo D., The importance of non-forest landscapes for the conservation of forest bats: lessons from barbastelles (Barbastella barbastellus), Biodivers.

However, little is known about the interaction of these two variables, especially during key reproductive phases in important temperate food crops, such as soybean (Glycine max). Here, we grew soybean under elevated [CO2] and imposed high- (+9°C) and low- (+5°C) intensity heat waves during key temperature-sensitive reproductive stages (R1, flowering; R5, pod-filling) to determine how elevated [CO2] will interact with heat waves to influence soybean yield. High-intensity heat waves, which resulted in canopy temperatures that exceeded optimal growth temperatures for soybean, reduced yield compared to ambient conditions even under elevated [CO2]. This was largely due to heat stress on reproductive processes, especially during R5. Low-intensity heat waves did not affect yields when applied during R1 but increased yields when applied during R5 likely due to relatively lower canopy temperatures and higher soil moisture, which uncoupled the negative effects of heating on cellular- and leaf-level processes from plant-level carbon assimilation. Modeling soybean yields based on carbon assimilation alone underestimated yield loss with high-intensity heat waves and overestimated yield loss with low-intensity heat waves, thus supporting the influence of direct heat stress on reproductive processes in determining yield. These results have implications for rain-fed cropping systems and point toward a climatic tipping point for soybean yield when future heat waves exceed optimum temperature. Published 2019.

However, observational evidence of this influence at larger spatial scales and across diverse bioclimatic regions is lacking. Here, we investigated the interannual effects of winter (here defined as previous October to current February) snow depth on tree growth across temperate China over the period of 1961–2015, using a regional network of tree ring records, in situ daily snow depth observations, and gridded climate data. We report uneven effects of winter snow depth on subsequent growing-season tree growth across temperate China. There shows little effect on tree growth in drier regions that we attribute mainly to limited snow accumulation during winter. By contrast, winter snow exerts important positive influence on tree growth in stands with high winter snow accumulation (e.g., in parts of cold arid regions). The magnitude of this effect depends on the proportion of winter snow to pre-growing-season (previous October to current April) precipitation. We further observed that tree growth in drier regions tends to be increasingly limited by warmer growing-season temperature and early growing-season water availability. No compensatory effect of winter snow on the intensifying drought limitation of tree growth was observed across temperate China. Our findings point toward an increase in drought vulnerability of temperate forests in a warming climate. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",drought; snow depth; temperate China; tree growth; tree ring chronology; water use,"China; Climate; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Seasons; Snow; Trees; China; snow; chronology; drought; environmental effect; growth rate; snow cover; tree ring; water use; winter; China; climate; climate change; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; season; tree",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China, (2016YFD060020603); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41530747, 41571038); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, ESPRE, (2017‐ZY‐06); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","Funding text 1: We greatly thank all contributors for tree ring chronologies used in this study.

However, few studies simultaneously investigate multiple traits and the life stages at which changes manifest. We experimentally manipulated ALAN intensities, within those found in the natural environment, to explore the consequences for growth, survival, and reproductive success of the field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. We reared crickets from egg to adult under a daily light-cycle consisting of 12 hr bright daylight (2,600 lx) followed by either 12 hr darkness (0 lx) or dim-light environments (1, 10, or 100 lx). We found egg hatch, adult survival, and reproductive measures were largely comparable for all treatments. However, juvenile development time (number of days from egg to adult) was on average 10 days (14%) longer and adults were also larger when crickets were exposed to any light at night (1, 10, or 100 lx). Our data demonstrate that chronic lifetime exposure to ALAN can modulate the timing of life-history events and may disrupt phenology to a similar extent as other abiotic factors. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",development;

Increasing temperatures and altered hydrology are driving shifts in ecosystem biophysical properties that, observed by satellites, manifest as long-term changes in regional NDVI. In an effort to examine the underlying ecological drivers of these changes, we used field-scale remote sensing of NDVI to track peatland vegetation in experiments that manipulated hydrology, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ) levels. In addition to NDVI, we measured percent cover by species and leaf area index (LAI). We monitored two peatland types broadly representative of the boreal region. One site was a rich fen located near Fairbanks, Alaska, at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX), and the second site was a nutrient-poor bog located in Northern Minnesota within the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found that NDVI decreased with long-term reductions in soil moisture at the APEX site, coincident with a decrease in photosynthetic leaf area and the relative abundance of sedges. We observed increasing NDVI with elevated temperature at the SPRUCE site, associated with an increase in the relative abundance of shrubs and a decrease in forb cover. Warming treatments at the SPRUCE site also led to increases in the LAI of the shrub layer. We found no strong effects of elevated CO                             2                              on community composition. Our findings support recent studies suggesting that changes in NDVI observed from satellite platforms may be the result of changes in community composition and ecosystem structure in response to climate warming.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",boreal peatlands; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; NDVI; remote sensing; soil moisture; warming,Alaska; Arctic Regions; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrology; Minnesota; Plants; Soil; Alaska; Fairbanks; Minnesota; United States; Carex; Picea; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; ecological impact; hydrological change; long-term change; NDVI; peatland; remote sensing; soil moisture; warming; Alaska; Arctic; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; climate change; environmental monitoring; hydrology; metabolism; Minnesota; plant; soil,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, ; Soil, ",,,"Bonanza Creek LTER; Michigan Tech University; Office of Biological and Environmental Research; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science; University of Minnesota Department of Forest Resources; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1636476, DEB‐0423442, LTREB 1354370); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NNX14AF96G); Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; U.S. Forest Service, USFS, (PNW01‐JV11261952‐231); University of Minnesota, UM; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, AAES, (MIN‐42‐060); Northern Research Station, NRS","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation grant #DEB LTREB 1354370 (to ESK and MRT) and NASA grant #NNX14AF96G to (MJF and ESK), as well as cooperative agreements between the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station and the University of Minnesota and Michigan Tech University.

In birds, it has been hypothesized that artificial light at night can affect daily aspects of behaviour, but one caveat is the lack of knowledge about the light intensity that wild animals, such as birds, are exposed to during the night. Organisms have naturally evolved daily rhythms to adapt to the 24-h cycle of day and night, thus, it is important to investigate the potential shifts in daily cycles due to global anthropogenic processes such as urbanization. We captured adult male European blackbirds (Turdus merula) in one rural forest and two urban sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We tagged these birds with light loggers and simultaneously recorded changes in activity status (active/non-active) through an automated telemetry system. We first analysed the relationship between light at night, weather conditions and date with daily activity onset and end. We then compared activity, light at night exposure and noise levels between weekdays and weekends. Onset of daily activity was significantly advanced in both urban sites compared to the rural population, while end of daily activity did not vary either among sites. Birds exposed to higher amounts of light in the late night showed earlier onset of activity in the morning, but light at night did not influence end of daily activity. Light exposure at night and onset/end of daily activity timing was not different between weekdays and weekends, but all noise variables were. A strong seasonal effect was detected in both urban and rural populations, such as birds tended to be active earlier in the morning and later in the evening (relative to civil twilight) in the early breeding season than at later stages. Our results point at artificial light at night as a major driver of change in timing of daily activity. Future research should focus on the costs and benefits of altered daily rhythmicity in birds thriving in urban areas. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Biological rhythms; Light at night; Light loggers;

For animals that migrate nocturnally, anthropogenic light can interfere with migration routes, flight altitudes, and social activities that accompany migration, such as acoustic communication. We investigated the effect of anthropogenic light on nocturnal migration of birds through the Great Lakes ecosystem. Specifically, we recorded the vocal activity of migrating birds and compared the number of nocturnal flight calls produced above rural areas with ground-level artificial lights compared to nearby areas without lights. We show that more nocturnal flight calls are detected over artificially lit areas. The median number of nocturnal flight calls recorded at sites with artificial lights (31 per night, interquartile range: 15-135) was 3 times higher than at nearby sites without artificial lights (11 per night, interquartile range: 4-39). By contrast, the number of species detected at lit and unlit sites did not differ significantly (artificially lit sites: 6.5 per night, interquartile range: 5.0-8.8; unlit sites: 4.5 per night, interquartile range: 2.0-7.0). We conclude that artificial lighting changes the behavior of nocturnally migrating birds. The increased detections could be a result of ground-level light sources altering bird behavior during migration. For example, birds might have changed their migratory route to pass over lit areas, flown at lower altitudes over lit areas, increased their calling rate over lit areas, or remained longer over lit areas. Our results for ground-level lights correspond to previous findings demonstrating that migratory birds are influenced by lights on tall structures. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.",anthropogenic light;

That lighting can repel nesting females and interfere with the orientation of hatchlings from the nest to the sea. Disrupted hatchling orientation is a serious source of turtle mortality, sufficient to reduce recruitment and contribute to a long-term marine turtle population decline. The purpose of this study was to assess whether artificial lighting disrupts hatchling sea-finding behaviour at the largest loggerhead rookery in the South Pacific, the Woongarra coast, south-east Queensland. The crawling tracks of hatchlings that emerged from nests, as well as staged emergences, were used to assess the effect of lighting conditions at several local beaches on hatchling sea-finding behaviour. Disrupted orientation was observed at only a few locations, excluding the majority of the main nesting beach at Mon Repos Conservation Park. At the sites where orientation was disrupted, normal orientation was restored when a full moon was visible, presumably because lunar illumination reduced the perceived brightness of the artificial lights. The controlled use of lights used for guided turtle-viewing tour groups within Mon Repos conservation Park did not interfere with the sea-finding behaviour of hatchling turtles. Further coastal development, especially at the nearby town of Bargara, requires that a light management plan be formulated to ensure that development does not adversely affect the marine turtles that utilise the local nesting beaches. © 2013 CSIRO.",disorientation; sea turtle hatchling,Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Queensland; coastal development; light effect; lightning; marine environment; mortality; population decline; recruitment (population dynamics); turtle,,,,,,,"Adamany S.L., Salmon M., Witherington B.E., Behavior of sea turtles at an urban beach.

Yet one of the pressures these ecosystems face, nighttime lighting, remains unstudied. Light is an important cue in guiding the settlement of invertebrate larvae, and altering natural regimes of nocturnal illumination could modify patterns of recruitment among sessile epifauna. We present the first evidence of night-time lighting changing the composition of temperate epifaunal marine invertebrate communities. Illuminating settlement surfaces with white light-emitting diode lighting at night, to levels experienced by these communities locally, both inhibited and encouraged the colonization of 39% of the taxa analysed, including three sessile and two mobile species. Our results indicate that ecological light pollution from coastal development, shipping and offshore infrastructure could be changing the composition of marine epifaunal communities. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

L2S 3A1, 500 Glenridge Avenue, Canada","Artificial night lighting (or ecological light pollution) is only now gaining attention as a source of long-term effects on the ecology of both diurnal and nocturnal animals. The limited data available clearly indicate that artificial light can affect physiology and behaviour of animals, leading to ecological consequences at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. Aquatic ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to such effects, and nocturnally breeding animals such as frogs may be especially affected. To address this potential, we quantify the effects of artificial light on calling and movement behaviour in a rural population of male green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota (Rafinesque, 1820)) during the breeding season. When exposed to artificial light, frogs produced fewer advertisement calls and moved more frequently than under ambient light conditions. Results clearly demonstrate that male green frog behaviour is affected by the presence of artificial light in a manner that has the potential to reduce recruitment rates and thus affect population dynamics. © 2006 NRC.",,Animalia; Anura; Rana clamitans; Rana clamitans melanota; Behavioral research; Biodiversity; Climate change; Physiology; Rural areas; Social aspects; behavioral response; breeding season; calling behavior; frog; light effect; male behavior; movement; nocturnal activity; population dynamics; reproductive behavior; Artificial light; Green frogs; Population dynamics; Rana clamitans melanota; Ecology,,,,,,,"Berry R.L., Light pollution in southern Ontario.

Owing to its role in the circadian timing system, melatonin production is suspected to mediate excess nocturnal light. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of light pollution on the timing of seasonal reproduction on a strict Malagasy long-day breeder, the nocturnal mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). We randomly exposed 12 males in wintering sexual rest to moonlight or to a light-mimicking nocturnal streetlight for 5 weeks. We monitored urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations (aMT6s), plasma testosterone concentrations, and testis size, and we recorded daily rhythms of core temperature and locomotor activity. In males exposed to light pollution, we observed a significant decrease in urinary aMT6s concentrations associated with changes in daily rhythm profiles and with activation of reproductive function. These results showed that males entered spontaneous sexual recrudescence leading to a summer acclimatization state, which suggests that light at night disrupts perception of day length cues, leading to an inappropriate photoentrainment of seasonal rhythms. © 2016 American Society of Mammalogists.",ALAN; core temperature; locomotor activity; melatonin; Microcebus murinus; primate; testosterone,Lemur; Lemuridae; Microcebus murinus; Primates; acclimation; bioaccumulation; concentration (composition); day length; light pollution; locomotion; male; mimicry; nocturnal activity; primate; reproduction; testosterone,,,,,,,"Arendt J., Role of the pineal gland and melatonin in seasonal reproductive function in mammals, Oxford Reviews of Reproductive Biology, 8, pp. 266-320, (1986); Aube M., Roby J., Kocifaj M., Evaluating potential spectral impacts of various artificial lights on melatonin suppression, photosynthesis and star visibility, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Aujard F., Boissy I., Claustrat B., Melatonin secretion in a nocturnal prosimian primate: Effect of photoperiod and aging, Biological Clocks: Mechanisms and Applications, pp. 337-340, (1998); Bedrosian T., Vaughn C.A., Galan A., Daye G., Weil Z.M., Nelson R.J., Nocturnal light exposure impairs affective responses in a wavelength-dependent manner, Journal of Neuroscience, 33, pp. 13081-13087, (2013); Bonmati-Carrion M.A., Et al., Protecting melatonin rhythm through circadian healthy light exposure, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 15, pp. 23448-23500, (2014); Bradshaw W.E., Holzapfel C.M., Light, time, and the physiology of biotic response to rapid climate change in animals, Annual Review of Physiology, 72, pp. 147-166, (2010); Brainard G.C., Et al., Action spectrum for melatonin regulation in humans: Evidence for a novel receptor, Journal of Neuroscience, 21, pp. 6405-6412, (2001); Bronson F.H., Climate change and seasonal reproduction in mammals Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B, Biological Sciences, 364, pp. 3331-3340, (2009); Cajochen C., Et al., Evening exposure to light-emitting diodes (LED)-backlit computer screen affects circadian physiology and cognitive performance, Journal of Applied Physiology, 110, pp. 1432-1438, (2011); Dacke M., Byrne M.J., Baird E., Scholt Z.C.H., Warrant E.J., How dim is dim?

One major, yet poorly studied, change in the environment is the increase in nocturnal light pollution. Although this strongly alters the habitat of nocturnal species, the ecological consequences are poorly known. Moths are well known to be attracted to artificial light sources, but artificial light may affect them in other ways as well. 2. In this study, female Mamestra brassicae moths were subjected to various types of low-intensity artificial night lighting with contrasting spectral compositions (green-rich, red-rich, warm white) or to a dark control treatment and the effects on their sex pheromone production and composition were tested. 3. Artificial night lighting reduced sex pheromone production and altered the chemical composition of the pheromone blend, irrespective of spectral composition. Specifically, amounts of the main pheromone component Z11-16:Ac were reduced, while the deterring compounds Z9-14:Ac, Z9-16:Ac, and Z11-16:OH were increased relative to Z11-16:Ac when females were kept under artificial light. These changes may reduce the effectiveness of the sex pheromones, becoming less attractive for males. 4. These results show for the first time that artificial light at night affects processes that are involved in moth reproduction. The potential for mitigation through manipulation of the spectral composition of artificial light appears limited. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.",Disruption; Light pollution; Mamestra brassicae; Sex pheromone composition; Sexual communication,Lepidoptera; Mamestra brassicae; Noctuidae; biochemical composition; biological production; communication behavior; ecological impact; environmental disturbance; female; habitat fragmentation; light intensity; light pollution; moth; nightglow; pollution effect; reproductive productivity; sex pheromone,,,,,,,"Agee H.R., Spectral sensitivity of the compound eyes of field-collected adult bollworms and tobacco budworms, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 66, pp. 613-615, (1973); Aitchison J., The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data, (1986); Backman A.C., Bengtsson M., Witzgall P., Pheromone release by individual females of codling moth, Cydia pomonella, Journal of Chemical Ecology, 23, pp. 807-815, (1997); Bazinet A.L., Cummings M.P., Mitter K.T., Mitter C.W., Can RNA-Seq resolve the rapid radiation of advanced moths and butterflies (Hexapoda: Lepidoptera: apoditrysia)?

We hypothesised that artificial light at night would reduce the activity of aquatic insects, resulting in reduced drift rates, lower fish growth rates and lower leaf litter decomposition rates. We tested these hypotheses by installing street lights to reaches in four forested, natural streams of coastal British Columbia each paired with a control reach. Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) are the top predators in these streams and feed mostly on terrestrial and drifting aquatic invertebrates. We found that the night-time drift of aquatic invertebrates in lit reaches was ~50% of the drift in dark reaches. However, the density of emerging aquatic insects, the density of insects falling into reaches, leaf litter decomposition rate and the number and growth rate of trout caught were not significantly different between the dark and experimentally lit reaches. We conclude that, while short-term exposure to artificial light during the summer changes invertebrate behaviour, it does not significantly alter other trophic levels in forested headwater streams. Our results suggest that low levels of artificial light do not strongly influence stream ecosystems, but future research should determine whether this is true for all seasons and longer-term exposure to light. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Cutthroat trout; Drift; Invertebrates; Light pollution; Urbanisation,Invertebrata; Oncorhynchus clarkii,,,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,"Acharya L., Fenton M.B., Bat attacks and moth behaviour around street lights, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 27-33, (1999); Anholt B.R., Density dependence resolves the stream drift paradox, Ecology, 76, pp. 2235-2239, (1995); Bernhardt E.S., Palmer M.A., Restoring streams in an urbanizing world, Freshwater Biology, 52, pp. 738-751, (2007); Bishop J.E., Light control of aquatic insect activity and drift, Ecology, 50, pp. 371-380, (1969); Boss S.M., Richardson J.S., Effects of food and cover on the growth, survival, and movement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in coastal streams, Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 59, pp. 1044-1053, (2002); Bruning A., Holker F., Wolter C., Artificial light at night: implications for early life stages development in four temperate freshwater fish species, Aquatic Sciences, 73, pp. 143-152, (2011); Buchanan B.W., Effects of enhanced lighting on the behavior of nocturnal frogs, Animal Behavior, 45, pp. 893-899, (1993); Cinzano P., Falchi F., Elvidge C.D., The first world atlas of artificial lighting and its impact on the landscape, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 328, pp. 689-707, (2001); Contor C.R., Griffith J.S., Nocturnal emergence of juvenile rainbow trout from winter concealment relative to light intensity, Hydrobiologia, 299, pp. 179-183, (1995); Culp J.M., Scrimgeour G.J., Size-dependent diel foraging periodicity of a mayfly grazer in streams with and without fish, Oikos, 68, pp. 242-250, (1993); Davies T.W., Bennie J., Gaston K.J., Street lighting changes the composition of invertebrate communities, Biology Letters, 8, pp. 764-767, (2012); Elliott J.M., Methods of sampling invertebrate drift in running water, Annales de Limnologie, 6, pp. 133-159, (1970); Feminella J.W., Hawkins C.P., Interactions between stream herbivores and periphyton: a quantitative analysis of past experiments, Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 14, pp. 465-509, (1995); Fraser N.H.C., Metcalfe N.B., The costs of becoming nocturnal: feeding efficiency in relation to light intensity in juvenile Atlantic Salmon, Functional Ecology, 11, pp. 385-391, (1997); Heiling A.M., Why do nocturnal orb-web spiders (Araneidae) search for light?, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 46, pp. 43-49, (1999); Hershey A.E., Pastor J., Peterson B.J., Kling G.W., Stable isotopes resolve the drift paradox for Baetis mayflies in an Arctic river, Ecology, 74, pp. 2315-2325, (1993); Holker F., Wolter C., Perkin E.K., Tockner K., Light pollution as a biodiversity threat, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 25, pp. 681-682, (2010); Holker F., Moss T., Griefahn B., Kloas W., Voigt C.C., Henckel D., Et al., The dark side of light: a transdisciplinary research agenda for light pollution policy, Ecology and Society, 15, (2010); Jackson J.K., Diel emergence, swarming and longevity of selected adult aquatic insects from a Sonoran Desert stream, American Midland Naturalist, 119, pp. 344-352, (1988); Kiffney P.M., Richardson J.S., Bull J.P., Responses of periphyton and insects to experimental manipulation of riparian buffer width along forest streams, Journal of Applied Ecology, 40, pp. 1060-1076, (2003); Kummu M., de Moel H., Ward P.J., Varis O., How close do we live to water?

Previous work suggested that light pollution can affect both seasonal and daily patterns of behavior. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of artificial night lighting and daytime traffic noise on the timing of dawn and dusk singing in 6 common songbirds. We recorded singing behavior in 11 nonurban plots: 2 plots with light, but no noise, 3 with light and noise pollution, 3 with noise, but no light, and 3 undisturbed forests. Our results show that artificial night lighting, but not noise, leads to an earlier start of dawn singing in 5 out of 6 species, ranging on average from 10min for the song thrush to 20min for the robin and the great tit. This effect was strongest at higher light intensities. We further show that dusk song is also affected: 3 species continued dusk singing for longer in lighted areas, but the effect was smaller than that observed for dawn song (from about 8min for the blackbird to 14min for the great tit). For all species, onset and cessation of singing changed relative to sunrise and sunset with the progress of the season. Rain delayed the onset of singing at dawn and advanced the cessation at dusk. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of sexual selection. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

Most studies report short-term consequences in locations that are also exposed to other anthropogenic disturbance. We know little about how the effects of nocturnal illumination vary with different light colour compositions. This is increasingly relevant as the use of LED lights becomes more common, and LED light colour composition can be easily adjusted.We experimentally illuminated previously dark natural habitat with white, green and red light, and measured the effects on life-history decisions and fitness in two free-living songbird species, the great tit (Parus major) and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) in two consecutive years. In 2013, but not in 2014,we found an effect of light treatment on lay date, and of the interaction of treatment and distance to the nearest lamp post on chick mass in great tits but not in pied flycatchers. We did not find an effect in either species of light treatment on breeding densities, clutch size, probability of brood failure, number of fledglings and adult survival. The finding that light colour may have differential effects opens up the possibility to mitigate negative ecological effects of nocturnal illumination by using different light spectra. © 2015 The Authors.

Artificial light at night (LAN), termed 'light pollution', is an often overlooked, yet increasing disruptor of habitats, which perturbs physiological processes that rely on precise light information. For example, LAN alters the timing of reproduction and activity in some species, which decreases the odds of successful breeding and increases the threat of predation for these individuals, leading to reduced fitness. LAN also suppresses immune function, an important proxy for survival. To investigate the impact of LAN in a species naive to light pollution in its native habitat, immune function was examined in Siberian hamsters derived from wild-caught stock. After four weeks exposure to dim LAN, immune responses to three different challenges were assessed: (i) delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), (ii) lipopolysaccharide-induced fever, and (iii) bactericide activity of blood. LAN suppressed DTH response and reduced bactericide activity of blood after lipopolysaccharide treatment, in addition to altering daily patterns of locomotor activity, suggesting that human encroachment on habitats via night-time lighting may inadvertently compromise immune function and ultimately fitness. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Bactericide; Delayed-type hypersensitivity; Light pollution; Lipopolysaccharide; Phodopus sungorus,"Animals; Blood Bactericidal Activity; Circadian Rhythm; Cricetinae; Fever; Hypersensitivity, Delayed; Immunity; Light; Lipopolysaccharides; Locomotion; Phodopus; Cricetinae; Phodopus sungorus; lipopolysaccharide; adaptation; blood; fitness; immune response; light pollution; locomotion; niche partitioning; physiological response; polysaccharide; survival; animal; circadian rhythm; delayed hypersensitivity; fever; hamster; immunity; immunology; light; locomotion; Phodopus; review; serum bactericidal activity",,"Lipopolysaccharides, ",,,,,"Kempenaers B., Borgstrom P., Loes P., Schlicht E., Valcu M., Artificial night lighting affects dawn song, extra-pair siring success, and lay date in songbirds, Curr.

Anthropogenic light and noise have modified differences between day and night, and may thereby interfere with circadian clocks. Urbanized species, such as birds, are known to advance their activity to early morning and night hours. We hypothesized that such modified activity patterns are reflected by properties of the endogenous circadian clock. Using automatic radio-telemetry, we tested this idea by comparing activity patterns of free-living forest and city European blackbirds (Turdus merula). We then recaptured the same individuals and recorded their activity under constant conditions. City birds started their activity earlier and had faster but less robust circadian oscillation of locomotor activity than forest conspecifics. Circadian period length predicted start of activity in the field, and this relationship was mainly explained by fast-paced and early-rising city birds. Although based on only two populations, our findings point to links between city life, chronotype and circadian phenotype in songbirds, and potentially in other organisms that colonize urban habitats, and highlight that urban environments can significantly modify biologically important rhythms in wild organisms. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We hypothesized that in response to artificial illumination A. cahirinus will decrease its activity and A. russatus will increase its activity, and thus temporal overlap and interspecific competition could increase. Our study took place in 4 field enclosures: the 1st and 3rd months were controls with natural light, and in the 2nd month artificial illumination, simulating low levels of light pollution, was set for the first 3 h of the night. We implanted temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to monitor mouse activity, and individual identification tags with automonitored foraging patches were used to track foraging behavior. A. cahirinus decreased activity and foraging with artificial lighting, restricting movement particularly in less-sheltered microhabitats, probably because of increased predation risk. Because illumination restricted both activity time and space, intraspecific encounters of A. cahirinus over foraging patches increased during and following the illuminated hours. However, diurnal A. russatus did not expand its activity into the illuminated hours, possibly due to the presence of competing A. cahirinus, or to nonfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, overt interspecific competition was not affected by experimental light pollution. Light pollution had a negative influence by reducing overall activity and producing a relatively underexploited temporal niche, which may promote invasion of alien species that are less light sensitive; and by increasing intraspecific overlap in foraging A. cahirinus. © 2011 American Society of Mammalogists.",Acomys cahirinus; Acomys russatus; Activity patterns; Light night niche; Light pollution,Acomys;

However, at night such resources may lose attractiveness when they are in artificially lit areas. For bats, attraction to such manmade habitats might be species specific. In an isolated village in the Negev desert that is known for its high bat activity we investigated the effects of artificial lighting on flight behaviour of two aerial insectivorous bat species: Pipistrellus kuhlii, a non-desert synanthropic bat, common in urban environments and Eptesicus bottae, a desert-dwelling species. Using an acoustic tracking system we reconstructed flight trajectories for bats that flew under artificial lights [Light treatment (L)] versus in natural darkness [Dark treatment (D)]. Under L both P. kuhlii and E. bottae flew significantly faster than under D. Under L, P. kuhlii also flew at significantly lower altitude (i.e. away from a floodlight) than under D. Whereas P. kuhlii foraged both in L and D, E. bottae only foraged in D. In L, activity of E. bottae decreased and it merely transited the illuminated area at commuting rather than foraging speed. Thus, under artificially lighted conditions the non-desert synanthropic species may have a competitive advantage over the native desert species and may outcompete it for aerial insect prey. Controlling light pollution in deserts and keeping important foraging sites unlit may reduce the synanthropic species' competitive advantage over native desert bats. © 2011 The Authors.

In urbanized bird species, light-at-night advances important biological rhythms such as daily cycles of activity/rest and timing of reproduction, but our knowledge of the underlying physiological mechanisms is limited. Given its role as chronobiological signal, melatonin is a strong candidate for mediating the effects of light-at-night. Results: We exposed urban and rural European blackbirds (Turdus merula) to two light treatments equal in photoperiod but with different light intensities at night. The control group was exposed to 0.0001 lux (almost darkness), while the experimental group was exposed to 0.3 lux at night, simulating conditions recorded previously on free-living urban blackbirds. We obtained diel profiles of plasma melatonin for all birds in summer (July) and winter (January), while simultaneously recording locomotor activity. Daily patterns of melatonin concentrations were clearly affected by light-at-night in both seasons. In winter, melatonin concentrations of light-at-night birds were lower in the early and late night than in those of birds kept in darkness. In summer, melatonin concentrations of the light-at-night birds were lower through all night compared to birds kept in darkness. Locomotor activity in light-at-night birds was overall higher than in control individuals, both during the day and at night, and it increased sharply before dawn. In winter, the amount of activity before dawn in the light-at-night group correlated with changes in melatonin from midnight to late night: the greater the decrease in melatonin, the greater the amount of pre-dawn activity. Urban and rural birds responded similarly to light-at-night with respect to melatonin, but differed in their behaviour, with rural birds showing more locomotor activity than urban counterparts. Conclusions: This study points to reduced melatonin release at night as a potential physiological mechanism underlying the advanced onset of morning activity of urbanized birds. Based on the pattern of melatonin secretion, we suggest that birds responded to light-at-night as if they were exposed to a longer day than birds kept under dark nights. © 2013 Dominoni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Birds; Circadian rhythms; GnIH; Light-at-night; Locomotor activity; Melatonin; Timing of reproduction; Urbanization,Aves; Passeri; Turdus merula,,,,,Baden-Württemberg Stiftung; Volkswagen Foundation,"J.P. was funded by Volkswagen Foundation (“Initiative Evolutionary Biology”).

The rate of turnover of soil organic carbon is mediated by soil microorganisms whose activity may be affected by climate change. After one year of multifactorial climate change treatments, at an undisturbed temperate heathland, soil microbial community dynamics were investigated by injection of a very small concentration (5.12 μg C g-1 soil) of 13C-labeled glycine ( 13C2, 99 atom %) to soils in situ. Plots were treated with elevated temperature (+1°C, T), summer drought (D) and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (510 ppm [CO2]), as well as combined treatments (TD, TCO2, DCO2 and TDCO2). The 13C enrichment of respired CO2 and of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) was determined after 24 h. 13C- glycine incorporation into the biomarker PLFAs for specific microbial groups (Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, actinobacteria and fungi) was quantified using gas chromatography-combustion-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Gram positive bacteria opportunistically utilized the freshly added glycine substrate, i.e. incorporated 13C in all treatments, whereas fungi had minor or no glycine derived 13C- enrichment, hence slowly reacting to a new substrate. The effects of elevated CO2 did suggest increased direct incorporation of glycine in microbial biomass, in particular in G+ bacteria, in an ecosystem subjected to elevated CO2. Warming decreased the concentration of PLFAs in general. The FACE CO2 was 13C-depleted (δ13C =12.2%) compared to ambient (δ13C = ∼-8%), and this enabled observation of the integrated longer term responses of soil microorganisms to the FACE over one year. All together, the bacterial (and not fungal) utilization of glycine indicates substrate preference and resource partitioning in the microbial community, and therefore suggests a diversified response pattern to future changes in substrate availability and climatic factors. © 2014 Andresen et al.",,Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Climate Change; Fungi; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Glycine; Soil Microbiology; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; fatty acid; glycine; carbon; carbon dioxide; glycine; Actinobacteria; article; carbon sink; climate change; combustion; community dynamics; controlled study; drought; environmental enrichment; environmental temperature; free air carbon dioxide enrichment; fungus; gas chromatography; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; greenhouse effect; heathland; isotope labeling; mass spectrometry; microbial biomass; microbial community; nonhuman; soil microflora; summer; bacterial phenomena and functions; chemistry; mass fragmentography; microbiology; physiology,,"carbon 13, 14762-74-4; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Dioxide, ; Carbon Isotopes, ; Glycine, ",,,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BBS/E/C/00005214)",,"Hobbie E.A., Johnson M.G., Rygiewicz P.T., Tingey D.T., Olszyk D.M., Isotopic estimates of new carbon inputs into litter and soils in a four-year climate change experiment with Douglas-fir, Plant and Soil, 259, 1-2, pp. 331-343, (2004); Read D.J., Perez-Moreno J., Mycorrhizas and nutrient cycling in ecosystems - A journey towards relevance?, New Phytologist, 157, 3, pp. 475-492, (2003); Bol R., Eriksen J., Smith P., Garnett M.H., Coleman K., Christensen B.T., The natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>34</sup>S and <sup>14</sup>C in archived (1923-2000) plant and soil samples from the Askov long-term experiments on animal manure and mineral fertilizer, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 19, 22, pp. 3216-3226, (2005); Bardgett R.D., Richter A., Bol R., Garnett M.H., Baumler R., Et al., Heterotrophic microbial communities use ancient carbon following glacial retreat, Biology Letters, 3, pp. 487-490, (2007); Dorrepaal E., Toet S., Van Logtestijn R.S.P., Swart E., Van De Weg M.J., Et al., Carbon respiration from subsurface peat accelerated by climate warming in the subarctic, Nature, 460, pp. 616-620, (2009); Luo Y., Hui D., Zhang D., Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> stimulates net accumulations of carbon and nitrogen in land ecosystems: A meta-analysis, Ecology, 87, 1, pp. 53-63, (2006); Amelung W., Brodowski S., Sandhage-Hofmann A., Bol R., Combining biomarker with stable isotope analyses for assessing the transformations and turnover soil organic matter, Advances in Agronomy, 100, pp. 155-250, (2008); Ineson P., Coward P.A., Hartwig U.A., Soil gas fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> beneath Lolium perenne under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>: The Swiss free air carbon dioxide enrichment experiment, Plant and Soil, 198, 1, pp. 89-95, (1998); Nowak R.S., Ellsworth D.S., Smith S.D., Functional responses of plants to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> - Do photosynthetic and productivity data from FACE experiments support early predictions?, New Phytologist, 162, 2, pp. 253-280, (2004); Michelsen A., Rinnan R., Jonasson S., Two decades of experimental manipulations of heaths and forest understory in the subarctic, Ambio, 41, SUPPL.3, pp. 218-230, (2012); Wookey P.A., Aerts R., Bardgett R.D., Baptist F., Brathen K.A., Et al., Ecosystem feedbacks and cascade processes: Understanding their role in the responses of Arctic and alpine ecosystems to environmental change, Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 1153-1172, (2009); Rinnan R., Michelsen A., Baath E., Fungi benefit from two decades of increased nutrient availability in tundra heath soil, PLoS ONE, 8, 2, (2013); Pritchard E., Rogers H.H., Prior S.A., Peterson C.M., Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and plant structure: A review, Global Change Biology, 5, pp. 807-837, (1999); Long S.P., Ainsworth E.A., Rogers A., Ort D.R., Rising Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide: Plants FACE the future, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 55, pp. 591-628, (2004); Albert K.R., Ro-Poulsen H., Mikkelsen T.N., Michelsen A., Van Der Linden L., Et al., Interactive effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, warming and drought on photosynthesis of Deschampsia flexuosa in a temperate heath ecosystem, Journal of Experimental Botany, 62, pp. 4253-4266, (2011); Ainsworth E.A., Long S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE)?

Since photoperiod is a regulator of the timing of reproduction in most temperate region birds, such light sources could potentially change the timing of reproduction. We compared the luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), and estradiol (E2) levels of tree sparrow (Passer montanus) populations sampled at two urban and two rural sites in China, and also performed a controlled photoperiod experiment to determine the influence of artificial light on the endocrine rhythm of these populations. LH levels of urban tree sparrows increased earlier than those of rural ones, but rural populations had higher LH peaks. A linear mixed model (LMM) indicates that increased exposure to light at night (LAN) significantly influenced the LH, T and E2 concentrations of free-living tree sparrows in urban environments compared to their rural counterparts. The results of the controlled photoperiod experiment showed that tree sparrows that were exposed to 6lux of light during the dark phase of the artificial photoperiod began to secrete LH earlier, and had lower peak LH levels, than control birds. A LMM indicates that LAN had a significant effect on LH levels in this experiment. Although urban tree sparrows began to secrete LH earlier than their rural counterparts, we found no corresponding advance in T or E2 secretion. On the contrary, peak T and E2 levels of urban birds were lower than those of rural birds. These results suggest that although anthropogenic light sources appear to advance the onset of LH secretion in urban tree sparrow populations, they also lower peak LH, and consequently levels of T and E2. A possible explanation for these observations is that greater exposure to anthropogenic light in urban environments stimulates LH secretion and may influence photosensitivity, but further experimental work is required to test this hypothesis. © 2014 .",Anthropogenic light; Reproductive endocrine rhythm; Tree sparrow; Urban environment,Animals; China; Estradiol; Light; Luteinizing Hormone; Photoperiod; Reproduction; Sparrows; Testosterone; Trees; Urbanization; estradiol; luteinizing hormone; testosterone; estradiol; luteinizing hormone; testosterone; adult; anthropogenic light; article; China; comparative study; controlled study; cosmological phenomena; estradiol blood level; female; hormone determination; hormone release; hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system; light; light exposure; luteinizing hormone blood level; luteinizing hormone release; male; nonhuman; Passer montanus; Passeridae; photoperiodicity; photosensitivity; priority journal; reproduction; rural area; testosterone blood level; urban area; urban rural difference; animal; photoperiodicity; physiology; sparrow; tree; urbanization,,"estradiol, 50-28-2; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; testosterone, 58-22-0; Estradiol, ; Luteinizing Hormone, ; Testosterone, ",,,"Minzu University of China 985 Program, (YLDX01013); National Nature Science Foundation of China, (30900181, 31372225); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (2008-B0844)","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on this manuscript.

Light is a continuous variable, but our knowledge on how individuals react to different light intensities during the night is limited. We therefore determined the relationship between night light intensity and the behaviour and physiology of great tits (Parus major). We measured daily activity patterns and melatonin levels in 35 males exposed to five different light intensities and found strong, dose-dependent effects. Activity onset was increasingly advanced, and activity offset delayed with higher light intensities. Furthermore, night-time activity increased and melatonin levels measured at midnight decreased with higher intensities. In this experimental study, we demonstrate for the first time dose-dependent effects of artificial light at night on birds' daily activity patterns and melatonin levels. Our results imply that these effects are not limited to a certain threshold, but emerge even when nocturnal light levels are slightly increased. However, in a natural area, these effects may be limited as artificial light levels are commonly low; light intensities drop rapidly with distance from a light source and birds can avoid exposure to light at night. Future studies should thus focus on examining the impact of different intensities of light at night in the wild. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial light at night; Circadian rhythm; Dose-response; Great tit; Light intensity; Melatonin,Actigraphy; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Lighting; Male; Melatonin; Motor Activity; Photic Stimulation; Photoperiod; Songbirds; melatonin; melatonin; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; dose response; light exposure; light intensity; male; night; nonhuman; Parus major; physiology; priority journal; protein blood level; rhythm; actimetry; adverse effects; animal; circadian rhythm; illumination; metabolism; motor activity; photoperiodicity; photostimulation; songbird,,"melatonin, 73-31-4; Melatonin, ",,,"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DBI-1306025); Ministerie van Economische Zaken, EZ; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen, STW; Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij voor Diergeneeskunde, KNMvD","We thank Marylou Aaldering and Franca Kropman for taking good care of our experimental birds, Gilles Wijlhuizen and Jeroen Laurens for technical assistance during the study and Barbara Helm and Davide Dominoni for fruitful discussions about the set-up of the experiment and comments on the manuscript.

This divergence from the natural environment may have significant implications for certain ecological niches because of the important influence light exerts on the circadian system. For example, circadian disruption and nighttime light exposure are linked to changes in immune function. The majority of studies investigating the effects of light exposure and circadian disruption on the immune system use nocturnal rodents. In diurnal species, many hormones and immune parameters vary with secretion patterns 180°out of phase to those of nocturnal rodents. Thus, the authors investigated the effects of nighttime light exposure on immunocompetence in diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). Rats were housed in either standard 14-h light (L):10-h dark (D) cycles with L ∼150 lux and D 0 lux or dim light at night (dLAN) cycles of LD 14:10 with L ∼150 lux and D 5 lux for 3 wks, then tested for plasma bactericidal capacity, as well as humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Rats exposed to dLAN showed increased delayed-type hypersensitivity pinna swelling, which is consistent with enhanced cell-mediated immune function. dLAN rats similarly showed increased antibody production following inoculation with keyhole lymphocyte hemocyanin (KLH) and increased bactericidal capacity. Daytime corticosterone concentrations were elevated in grass rats exposed to nighttime dim light, which may have influenced immunological measures. Overall, these results indicate nighttime light affects immune parameters in a diurnal rodent. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Arvicanthis niloticus; Bacteria killing; Delayed-type hypersensitivity; Grass rats; Keyhole lymphocyte; Light at night,Animals; Biological Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Corticosterone; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Hemocyanin; Immune System; Light; Male; Melatonin; Photoperiod; Radioimmunoassay; Rats; Time Factors; Acroceras macrum; Animalia; Arvicanthis niloticus; Rattus; Rodentia; corticosterone; hemocyanin; keyhole limpet hemocyanin; keyhole-limpet hemocyanin; melatonin; animal; article; biological rhythm; blood; circadian rhythm; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immune system; light; male; metabolism; methodology; photoperiodicity; physiology; radioimmunoassay; rat; time,,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; hemocyanin, 9013-72-3; melatonin, 73-31-4; Corticosterone, 50-22-6; Hemocyanin, 9013-72-3; Melatonin, 73-31-4; keyhole-limpet hemocyanin, ",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1118792, IOS 04-16897); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (2005-337)",We thank Laura Smale for providing the grass rats and for consultation on the study.

Many moth species are strongly attracted to sources of artificial night lighting, with potentially severe, yet poorly studied, consequences for development, reproduction and inter/intra-specific interactions. Here, we present results of a field-based experiment where we tested effects of various types of artificial lighting on mating in the winter moth (Operophtera brumata, Lepidoptera: Geometridae). We illuminated trunks of oak trees with green, white, red or no artificial LED light at night, and caught female O. brumata on these trunks using funnel traps. The females were dissected to check for the presence of a spermatophore, a sperm package that is delivered by males to females during mating. We found a strong reduction in the number of females on the illuminated trunks, indicating artificial light inhibition of activity. Furthermore, artificial light inhibited mating: 53% of females caught on non-illuminated trunks had mated, whereas only 13%, 16% and 28% of the females that were caught on green, white and red light illuminated trunks had mated respectively. A second experiment showed that artificial night lighting reduced the number of males that were attracted to a synthetic O. brumata pheromone lure. This effect was strongest under red light and mildest under green light. This study provides, for the first time, field-based evidence that artificial night lighting disrupts reproductive behaviour of moths, and that reducing short wavelength radiation only partly mitigates these negative effects. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.", Operophtera brumata; Light pollution; Reproduction; Sex pheromone; Spermatophore; Winter moth,,,,,,,,"Acharya L., Fenton M.B., Bat attacks and moth defensive behaviour around street lights, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 27-33, (1999); Agee H.R., Spectral sensitivity of the compound eyes of field-collected adult bollworms and tobacco budworms, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 66, pp. 613-615, (1973); Alma P.M., A study of the activity and behaviour of the winter moth, Operophtera brumata (L.)

Natural succession of abandoned land could counter the loss of biodiversity, but the rate of natural reforestation is slow. Neotropical frugivorous bats facilitate natural succession because they seem to tolerate habitat disturbance when dispersing seeds of pioneer plants. Under naturally dark conditions, bats produce a copious seed rain even in deforested habitats and connect distant forest fragments. Yet, artificial light at night may compromise bat-mediated seed dispersal if bats avoid lit areas. This may delay or jeopardize natural forest succession in fragmented tropical landscapes. We asked whether the foraging behaviour of Sowell's short-tailed bats Carollia sowelli, a specialist on infructescences of pepper plants (Piperaceae), is negatively affected by artificial light at night. First, in a dual choice experiment with captive bats, we demonstrate that food was less often explored and consumed in the dimly illuminated than in the dark compartment, indicating that artificial light alters the foraging behaviour of fruit-eating bats. Secondly, using observations in free-ranging bats, we found that infructescences were less likely to be harvested when plants were illuminated by a street lamp than under natural darkness. Synthesis and applications. Natural succession of deforested areas and connectivity of remaining forest patches may suffer due to artificial light at night through a reduction in nocturnal seed disperser activity in lit areas. This could have negative impacts on biodiversity and consequent effects on land erosion, particularly in developing countries of the tropics where light pollution increases rapidly with growing economies and human populations. Mitigation requires that the use of artificial light should be limited in space, time and intensity to the minimum necessary. The effectiveness of 'darkness corridors' to enhance fragment connectivity and to reduce species loss should be evaluated. Policy-makers of tropical countries should become aware of the potential detrimental effects of artificial lighting on wildlife and ecosystem functioning. © 2014 The Authors.

However, not all individuals housed under such conditions develop stereotypic behaviours. One hypothesis to explain such variation is personality (i.e. individual) differences. We tested this hypothesis in the African striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus and predicted that stereotypic individuals would have a bolder personality and a proactive coping style than non-stereotypic individuals. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, adult stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice were tested for their personality using three tests (i.e. light-dark, startle-response and novel-object tests). Subsequently, we recorded the behaviours of individuals every second day for 30 days in standard laboratory housing. Stereotypic striped mice were proactive and showed a bolder personality type by spending longer time in the light compartment after a startle response, showed greater manipulation of cage objects and were more active than non-stereotypic individuals in standard housing. In the second experiment, we tested the personality of juvenile striped mice before the onset of stereotypic behaviours. Again, the startle response test correlated with the onset of stereotypic behaviour in adults, with stereotypic mice that spent more time in the light compartment (i.e. bolder) showing a greater likelihood of displaying stereotypic behaviours later. Although our data provides support for the association between personality and stereotypic behaviour, these group-level effects (stereotypic vs. non-stereotypic) were not evident at the individual level, particularly for stereotypic mice. Therefore, having a proactive coping style did not predict the onset of stereotypic behaviour for all stereotypic individuals, highlighting individual trajectories for the development of stereotypic behaviours. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Coping styles; Ontogeny; Personality; Stereotypic behaviour; Striped mouse; Sub-optimal housing,Mus; Rhabdomys; ontogeny; rodent,,,,,"National Research Foundation, NRF, (76507)",We are grateful to Jacobeth Maloka for technical assistance.

Locomotor activity, four types of behaviour and plasma melatonin were analysed in groups of 12 adult Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) reared in captivity and held under four night illumination treatments: total darkness (control), high 50. lux intensity red light (group RH), low 5. lux intensity red light (group RL) and infrared light (group IR). All groups experienced the same conditions during the day (lights on from 07:00 to 19:00) with white lighting of 125. lux. Clarity of video images taken at night for the observation of fish behaviour were ranked as follows: group RH. >. RL. >. IR. >. control. All treatments presented a daily rhythm in locomotor activity with high activity from 14:00 to 18:00 and low activity from 21:00 to 12:00. The sole exposed to the high intensity red light at night appeared to be disturbed as during the low nocturnal locomotor activity period group RH presented higher activity and significantly higher nocturnal behaviour related to escape or fear than was observed in the other groups. The groups control, RL and IR exhibited similar levels of nocturnal locomotor activity and nocturnal behaviour related to escape or fear. Plasma melatonin, at mid-dark was not significantly different between the control and groups RL and IR, while melatonin was significantly lower in group RH compared to the control. The authors recommended low intensity red night illumination for the non-invasive study of nocturnal behaviour of Senegalese sole adults. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Behaviour; Locomotor activity; Melatonin; Night illumination; Solea senegalensis,melatonin; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; controlled study; darkness; illumination; image quality; infrared radiation; light intensity; locomotion; nonhuman; priority journal; red light; Solea senegalensis; spawning; videorecording,,"melatonin, 73-31-4",,,"Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, INIA; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (RTA2005-00113-00-00); Ministerio de Agricultura y Pesca, Alimentación y Medio Ambiente, MAPAMA","The authors gratefully thank J.

Previous studies on larval insect drift show that disruption in drift leads to changes in reproduction as well as intraspecific and interspecific interactions. The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the effects of extreme artificial light on insect drift in urbanized, high clarity spring systems of the karst Edwards Plateau, TX. We quantified taxa richness, diversity, and abundance in aquatic insect night time drift under two treatments (ambient night time light and artificial light addition) and among five streams using a paired design. Richness and diversity of drifting aquatic insects were similar between treatments but abundance was 37% less in the light addition treatment than that of the control. Effects of light addition on mean abundance was more notable in large streams with a 58% decrease in Simuliidae (compared to that of the control) and 51% decrease in Baetidae.

However, knowledge about long-term effects of chronic exposure to artificial light at night is still very limited. Here we present data on reproductive physiology, molt and locomotor activity during two-year cycles of European blackbirds (Turdus merula) exposed to either dark nights or 0.3 lux at night. As expected, control birds kept under dark nights exhibited two regular testicular and testosterone cycles during the two-year experiment. Control urban birds developed testes faster than their control rural conspecifics. Conversely, while in the first year blackbirds exposed to light at night showed a normal but earlier gonadal cycle compared to control birds, during the second year the reproductive system did not develop at all: both testicular size and testosterone concentration were at baseline levels in all birds. In addition, molt sequence in light-treated birds was more irregular than in control birds in both years. Analysis of locomotor activity showed that birds were still synchronized to the underlying light-dark cycle. We suggest that the lack of reproductive activity and irregular molt progression were possibly the results of i) birds being stuck in a photorefractory state and/or ii) chronic stress. Our data show that chronic low intensities of light at night can dramatically affect the reproductive system. Future studies are needed in order to investigate if and how urban animals avoid such negative impact and to elucidate the physiological mechanisms behind these profound long-term effects of artificial light at night. Finally we call for collaboration between scientists and policy makers to limit the impact of light pollution on animals and ecosystems. © 2013 Dominoni et al.",,Animals; Body Weights and Measures; Cities;

Appropriately timed light information is essential for maintaining circadian organization. Over the past ~120. years, urbanization and the widespread adoption of electric lights have dramatically altered lighting environments. Exposure to light at night (LAN) is pervasive in modern society and disrupts core circadian clock mechanisms. Because microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain and macrophages contain intrinsic circadian clocks, we hypothesized that chronic exposure to LAN would alter microglia cytokine expression and sickness behavior following LPS administration. Exposure to 4. weeks of dim LAN elevated inflammatory responses in mice. Mice exposed to dimly lit, as compared to dark, nights exaggerated changes in body temperature and elevated microglia pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following LPS administration. Furthermore, dLAN mice had a prolonged sickness response following the LPS challenge. Mice exposed to dark or dimly lit nights had comparable sickness behavior directly following the LPS injection; however, dLAN mice showed greater reductions in locomotor activity, increased anorectic behavior, and increased weight loss than mice maintained in dark nights 24. h post-LPS injection. Overall, these data suggest that chronic exposure to even very low levels of light pollution may alter inflammatory responses. These results may have important implications for humans and other urban dwelling species that commonly experience nighttime light exposure. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Circadian disruption; Light at night; LPS; Mice; Microglia; Sickness behavior,Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Cytokines; Fever; Inflammation; Light; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Mice; Microglia; Temperature; Circadian disruption; Light at night; LPS; Mice; Microglia; Sickness behavior; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; messenger RNA; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal experiment; article; body mass; body temperature; circadian rhythm; controlled study; food intake; illness behavior; illumination; inflammation; light; light exposure; light pollution; locomotion; long term exposure; male; microglia; mouse; night; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; scanning electron microscopy; weight reduction,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (IOS-11-18792); American Heart Association, AHA",The authors acknowledge Achikam Haim’s contribution to this work.

In aquatic ecosystems, artificial light at night (ALAN) may influence microbial communities living in the sediments. These communities are highly diverse and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. We combined field and laboratory experiments using sediments from an agricultural drainage system to examine how ALAN affects communities and alters carbon mineralization. Two identical light infrastructures were installed parallel to a drainage ditch before the start of the experiment. DNA metabarcoding indicated that both sediment communities were similar. After one was lit for five months (July–December 2012) we observed an increase in photoautotroph abundance (diatoms, Cyanobacteria) inALAN-exposed sediments. In laboratory incubations mimicking summer and winter (six weeks each), communities in sediments that were exposed to ALAN for 1 year (July 2012–June 2013) showed less overall seasonal change compared with ALAN-naive sediments. Nocturnal community respiration was reduced in ALAN-exposed sediments. In long-term exposed summer-sediments, we observed a shift from negative to positive net ecosystem production. Our results indicate ALAN may alter sediment microbial communities over time,with implications for ecosystem- level functions. It may thus have the potential to transform inland waters to nocturnal carbon sinks. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Amongst the possible factors that influence this advance (e.g., food availability, microclimate, predator regime, etc.), is exposure to artificial lights at night (LAN). LAN could stimulate the reproductive axis of the suburban jays. Alternatively, LAN could inhibit pineal melatonin (MEL), thus removing its inhibitory influence on the reproductive axis. Because Florida scrub-jays are a threatened species, we used western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) to investigate the effects of LAN upon reproductive hormones and melatonin. Jays were held under conditions in which the dark-phase of the light:dark cycle was without illumination and then under low levels of LAN. Under both conditions, birds were exposed first to short-days (9.5L:14.5D) that were gradually increased to long-days (14.5L:9.5D). At various times, blood samples were collected during the light part of the cycle to measure reproductive hormones (luteinizing hormone, LH; testosterone, T; and estradiol, E2). Similarly, samples to assess melatonin were collected during the dark. In males, LAN caused a depression in LH levels and levels were ∼4× greater under long- than short-days. In females, there was no effect of LAN or photoperiod upon LH. LAN resulted in depressed T levels in females, although there was no effect on T in males. E2 levels in both sexes were lower under LAN than under an unlighted dark-phase. Paradoxically, MEL was higher in jays under LAN, and under long-days. MEL did not differ by sex. LAN disrupted the extraordinarily strong correlation between T and E2 that existed under unlighted nocturnal conditions. Overall, our findings fail to support the hypothesis that LAN stimulates the reproductive axis. Rather, the data demonstrate that LAN tends to inhibit reproductive hormone secretion, although not in a consistent fashion between the sexes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Animals; Corticosterone;

Here, we review mechanisms by which artificial light at night may restructure ecological communities by modifying the interactions between species. Such mechanisms may be top-down (predator, parasite or grazer controlled), bottom-up (resource-controlled) or involve non-trophic processes, such as pollination, seed dispersal or competition. We present results from an experiment investigating both top-down and bottom-up effects of artificial light at night on the population density of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum in a diverse artificial grassland community in the presence and absence of predators and under low-level light of different spectral composition. We found no evidence for top-down control of A. pisum in this system, but did find evidence for bottom-up effects mediated through the impact of light on flower head density in a leguminous food plant. These results suggest that physiological effects of light on a plant species within a diverse plant community can have detectable demographic effects on a specialist herbivore. © 2015 The Authors.",Artificial light at night; Biotic interactions; Bottom-up effects; Community-level; Light pollution; Photopollution,Animals; Aphids; Beetles; Circadian Rhythm; Color; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Food Chain; Grassland; Herbivory; Lighting; Loteae; Oceans and Seas; Acyrthosiphon pisum; Animalia; bottom-up approach; competition (ecology); grassland; herbivore; light effect; light pollution; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; pollination; seed dispersal; top-down control; animal; aphid; beetle; circadian rhythm; color; environmental monitoring; food chain; grassland; herbivory; illumination; Lotus (genus); physiology; pollution; radiation response; sea,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (268504)",,"Longcore T., Rich C., Ecological light pollution, Front.

Squirrel gliders are known to occur in or around urban fringes where native vegetation is retained; however, little is known about specific anthropogenic factors that may affect their persistence. Aims We investigated the relative influence of biophysical and urban factors on the use of large hollow-bearing Eucalyptus trees, which are a key resource for squirrel gliders. The study was located in a typical urban growth area located in southern New South Wales. Methods A stratified random sampling approach was used to survey squirrel gliders in urban and rural areas. Infrared, motion-sensor cameras were placed in 34 selected trees for 17 nights to record squirrel glider occupancy and activity. Data on urban (e.g. light and noise pollution levels, road and housing density) and biophysical (e.g. tree height, hollow-bearing tree density, vegetation cover) variables were recorded at each survey tree. Data were statistically analysed using general linear modelling approaches. Key results Squirrel gliders were detected more frequently in the rural matrix (23.4% of camera trap-nights) than in urban areas (9.5%). Model results showed that tree height, and the distance to neighbouring trees, had a significant influence on the occurrence and activity of squirrel gliders. Road density and light pollution were included in 'best' models to explain glider activity (a negative influence), and noise pollution negatively influenced glider occurrence. Although gliders used large trees in both urban and rural areas, activity generally decreased as levels of urbanisation increased. Conclusions and implications Access to and availability of key resources such as tall, hollow-bearing trees is critical for gliders to persist in urban environments. Squirrel gliders will tolerate human stressors such as roads, noise and light pollution to a certain extent, but impacts on population viability remain largely unknown. Novel solutions need to be developed to lessen the effects of anthropogenic factors (such as light and noise) on patches of native vegetation retained in urban areas for conservation purposes. © CSIRO 2015.",aboreal fauna; camera traps; gliding; road ecology; tree age; tree height; urbanisation,Australia; New South Wales; Eucalyptus; Petaurus norfolcensis; activity pattern; anthropogenic effect; biophysics; conservation management; dicotyledon; gliding; light pollution; marsupial; noise pollution; resource availability; roadside environment; sensor; species occurrence; urban growth; urbanization; viability,,,,,,,"Feti Regional Population Growth, Australia, (2013); Arroyo-Solis A., Castillo J.M., Figueroa E., Lopez-Sanchez J.L., Slabbekoorn H., Experimental evidence for an impact of anthropogenic noise on dawn chorus timing in urban birds, Journal of Avian Biology, 44, pp. 288-296, (2013); Baker P.J., Harris S., Urban mammals: What does the future hold?

Industrial developments associated with the extraction of natural resources generate large amounts of artificial light. Marine turtles are particularly vulnerable to disruption from artificial light, thus effective management of lighting is critical in areas where industrial developments occur close to nesting habitat. Given the complexity of managing lighting in industry, ensuring an adequate lighting exclusion zone between the development and the beach may be the most effective strategy for limiting impacts, yet there appears to have been little focus on clearly delineating a distance which constitutes an ‘adequate’ buffer. Using arena assays, we assessed flatback turtle (Natator depressus) and green turtle (Chelonia mydas) hatchling sea-finding ability in response to three standard industrial light sources (high pressure sodium (HPSV), metal halide (MH) and fluorescent white (FW)), positioned at distances of 100, 200, 500 and 800 m. Sea-finding in both species was disrupted by all three light types when lights were positioned 200 m or closer, but not when lights were positioned ≥500 m away. However, when shielding the lights so that light glow, but not the luminaire itself, was visible from the arena, the observed sea-finding disruption was considerably reduced. Given that facilities are typically lit by numerous luminaires, our findings demonstrate that future industrial developments should be separated from nearby nesting beaches by a buffer of at least 1.5 km, as previously theorized, with all installed lighting appropriately shaded.

One of the most common themes in studies of fragmented habitats is finding higher rates of predation along habitat edges. However, field studies supporting this pattern are heavily influenced by avian literature and may not apply similarly to other organisms, such as invertebrates. Field studies of predation are typically performed during the day or do not distinguish between day and night; these studies therefore overlook daily fluctuations in predation and may miss important effects that occur solely at night, such as light pollution from streetlights. We tested whether predation of larval Lepidoptera differed between edge and core habitats and also whether predation along the habitat edge varied in response to light pollution from streetlights. We placed larvae in the core of suburban habitat patches and along the habitat edge, both under streetlights as well as between streetlights where it was dark. We found that predation rate increased in both edge and core habitats over the summer. Early season, we found daily fluctuations in predation dynamics with greater predation along the habitat edge than in the habitat core during the day, but not at night. Additionally, we found that streetlights did not affect predation rate along the habitat edge. Our results suggest that increased predation along habitat edges may be a diurnal effect. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Anthropogenic disturbance; Arthropods; Conservation of Lepidoptera; Edge effects; Light pollution; Temporal variation,Arthropoda; Aves; Invertebrata; Lepidoptera; anthropogenic effect; edge effect; habitat fragmentation; insect; larva; light pollution; predation; spatial variation; species conservation; temporal variation,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF-DEB 1026000); University of Denver, DU","We are grateful for funding from the University of Denver’s Undergraduate Research Center Partners in Scholarship grant awarded to Bergen Tjossem for this project.

Although part-night lighting schemes have been adopted by many local authorities across Europe to reduce the carbon footprint and save energy, their effects on biodiversity are unknown. Through a paired, in situ experiment, we compared the activity levels of 8 bat species under unlit, part-night, and full-night lighting treatments in a rural area located 60 km south of Paris, France. We selected 36 study locations composed of 1 lit site and a paired unlit control site; 24 of these sites were located in areas subject to part-night lighting schemes, and 12 sites were in areas under standard, full-night lighting. There was significantly more activity on part-night lighting sites compared to full-night lighting sites for the late-emerging, light-sensitive Plecotus spp., and a similar pattern was observable for Myotis spp., although not significant. In contrast, part-night lighting did not influence the activity of early emerging bat species around streetlights, except for Pipistrellus pipistrellus for which there was significantly less activity on part-night lighting sites than on full-night lighting sites. Overall, no significant difference in activity between part- and full-night lighting sites were observed in 5 of the 8 species studied, suggesting that current part-night lighting schemes fail to encompass the range of activity of most bat species. We recommend that such schemes start earlier at night to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of artificial lighting on light-sensitive species, particularly along ecological corridors that are especially important to the persistence of biodiversity in urban landscapes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bats;

Light at night causes an acute suppression of melatonin in nearly all vertebrate species. A previous study found that light failed to suppress melatonin in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. This is a surprising result given that the Anolis pineal gland is intrinsically photosensitive, is a key pacemaker controlling locomotor activity, and can be directly entrained to a light-dark cycle. To find out if the lack of photic suppression is widespread in the Anolis genus, we investigated the acute effects of light on melatonin secretion in five different species of Anolis using flow-through tissue culture. We administered a two-hour pulse of bright light to isolated pineal glands during the night. The results show photic suppression of melatonin in all five Anolis species, but the suppression is weak relative to that seen in other vertebrates. Moreover, Anolis species differ in the magnitude of the effect. These findings are discussed in the context of vertebrate pineal evolution and the ecology of Anolis lizards. Given their extensive phylogenetic and ecological divergence, Anolis lizards provide a promising system for investigating the ecology and evolution of circadian organization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Anolis; Circadian; Light; Lizard; Melatonin; Photosensitivity; Pineal,Animalia; Anolis; Anolis carolinensis; Squamata; Vertebrata; melatonin; animal experiment; animal tissue; Anolis carolinensis; article; circadian rhythm; controlled study; hormone release; light dark cycle; light exposure; lizard; locomotion; male; nonhuman; photosensitivity; pineal body; radioactivity; radioimmunoassay,,"melatonin, 73-31-4",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (0910075)","We thank Dr. Mark Rollag for graciously providing antiserum for radioimmunoassay and for valuable technical advice.

Short pulses of light given at night have been shown to rapidly depress NAT activity in some species, but not in others, the reasons for this difference being unclear. As diurnality and nocturnality of the experimental animals may play a role and since diurnally active animals have been little investigated in this respect, in the present study the diurnally active guinea pig was investigated. Male guinea pigs kept under a lighting regimen of LD 12:12 (lights off at 1700 hrs) were killed between 1200 or 1300 hrs and between 0000 and 0200 hrs, at night in the dark or after exposure to 10 or 45 min of light. The results obtained show that the day/night difference of NAT activity is about 2-fold. 10 min or 45 min of light given at night significantly depress pineal NAT activity. Re-exposure to darkness for 1 hr of animals previously given light for 10 min leads to restoration of NAT activity. These findings together with data from the literature suggest that it does not appear to be the activity pattern (diurnality versus nocturnality) of an animal nor the amplitude of the day/night difference of pineal NAT activity that account for the suppressibility or non-suppressibility of pineal NAT activity by light at night. © 1988 Springer Verlag.",light at night; Pineal gland; serotonin N-acetyltransferase,"Acetylserotonin N-Methyltransferase; Acetyltransferases; Animal; Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase; Gerbillinae; Guinea Pigs; Hamsters; Light; Male; Mesocricetus; Microtinae; Pineal Gland; Rats; Sciuridae; Sheep; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; melatonin; serotonin n acetyltransferase; animal cell; circadian rhythm; guinea pig; male; nonhuman; pineal body",,"melatonin, 73-31-4; Acetylserotonin N-Methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.4; Acetyltransferases, EC 2.3.1.; Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.5",,,,,"Brainard G.C., Richardson B.A., Petterborg L.J., Reiter R.J., The effect of different light intensities on pineal melatonin content, Brain Res, 233, pp. 75-81, (1982); Brainard G.C., Richardson B.A., King T.S., Matthews S.A., Reiter J.R., The suppression of pineal melatonin content and N-acetyltransferase activity by different light irradiances in the Syrian hamster: a dose-response relationship, Endocrinology, 113, pp. 293-296, (1983); Brainard G.C., Richardson B.A., Hurlbut E.D., Steinlechner S., Matthews S.A., Reiter R.J., The influence of various irradiances of artificial light, twilight, and moonlight on the suppression of pineal melatonin content in the Syrian Hamster, J Pineal Res, 1, pp. 105-119, (1984); Brainard G.C., Richardson B.A., King T.S., Reiter R.J., The influence of different light spectra on the suppression of pineal melatonin content in the Syrian hamster, Brain Res, 294, pp. 333-339, (1984); Brainard G.C., Richardson B.A., King T.S., Matthews S.A., Reiter R.J., The suppression of pineal melatonin content and N-acetyltransferase activity by different light irradiances in the Syrian hamster: a dose-response relationship, Endocrinology, 113, pp. 293-296, (1984); Champney T.H., Holtorf A.P., Steger R.W., Reiter R.J., Concurrent determination of enzymatic activities and substrate concentrations in the melatonin synthetic pathway within the same rat pineal gland, J Neurosci Res, 11, pp. 59-66, (1984); Deguchi T., Axelrod J., Sensitive assay for serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity in rat pineal, Anal Biochem, 50, pp. 174-179, (1972); Deguchi T., Axelrod J., Control of circadian change of serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity in the pineal organ by the beta adrenergic receptor, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 69, pp. 2547-2550, (1972); Hoffmann K., Illnerova H., Vanecek J., Pineal N-acetyltransferase activity in the Djungarian hamster.

Light pollution alters the behavior of sea turtles during nesting; therefore, long-wavelength lights - low-pressure sodium vapor and bug lights - that minimize impacts on turtles are required for beach lighting in Florida (U.S.A.). We investigated the effects of these two kinds of lights on the foraging behavior of Santa Rosa beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus leucocephalus). We compared patch use and giving-up densities of mice for experimental food patches established along a gradient of artificial light in the field. Mice exploited fewer food patches near both types of artificial light than in areas with little light and harvested fewer seeds within patches near bug lights. Our results show that artificial light affects the behavior of terrestrial species in coastal areas and that light pollution deserves greater consideration in conservation planning.",Artificial illumination; Foraging behavior; Light pollution; Peromyscus polionotus leucocephalus; Santa Rosa beach mice,Florida; North America; United States; Cheloniidae; Cricetinae; Peromyscus; Peromyscus polionotus; Peromyscus polionotus leucocephalus; Rodentia; Rosa; Testudines; beach; disturbance; foraging behavior; light; pollution; rodent,,,,,,,"Akesson S., Walinder G., Karlsson L., Ehnbom S., Reed warbler orientation: Initiation of nocturnal migratory flights in relation to visibility of celestial cues at dusk, Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 181-189, (2001); Bowers M.A., Seed removal experiments on desert rodents: The microhabitat by moonlight effect, Journal of Mammalogy, 69, pp. 201-204, (1988); Bowers M.A., Breland B., Foraging of gray squirrels on an urban-rural gradient: Use of the GUD to assess anthropogenic impact, Ecological Applications, 6, pp. 1135-1142, (1996); Brown J.S., Patch use as an indicator of habitat preference, predation risk, and competition, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 22, pp. 37-47, (1988); Buchanan B.W., Effects of enhanced lighting on the behaviour of nocturnal frogs, Animal Behaviour, 45, pp. 893-899, (1993); Cinzano P., Falchi F., Elvidge C.D., The first world atlas of the artificial night sky brightness, Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society, 328, pp. 689-707, (2001); Clark C.W., Levy D.A., Diel vertical migrations by juvenile sockeye salmon and the antipredation window, The American Naturalist, 131, pp. 271-290, (1988); Clarke J.A., Moonlight's influence on predator-prey interactions between short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) and deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus), Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 13, pp. 205-209, (1983); Humphrey S.R., Rare and Endangered Biota of Florida. 1.

Using this information, traits have adapted to allow individuals within specific niches to optimize survival and reproduction, but urbanization by humans has significantly altered natural habitats. Nighttime light exposure alters immune function in several species, which could lead to decreased fitness or survival, particularly in the face of an environmental challenge. We exposed male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) to five lux of light at night for four weeks, and then administered six hours of acute restraint stress. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was assessed immediately following stress. Acute restraint increased the DTH reaction in dark nights, but exposure to nighttime light prevented this response. Exposure to light at night prolonged the DTH response in non-stressed control hamsters. These results suggest that light pollution may significantly alter physiological responses in Siberian hamsters, particularly in response to a salient environmental challenge such as stress. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Immune function; Light pollution; Phodopus sungorus; Restraint stress,"Animals; Cricetinae; Hypersensitivity, Delayed; Light; Male; Phodopus; Stress, Physiological; Time Factors; Immune function; Light pollution; Phodopus sungorus; Restraint stress; acute stress; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; delayed hypersensitivity; fitness; immobilization stress; light at night; light exposure; light intensity; light pollution; male; nonhuman; Phodopus; priority journal; survival",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (11-18792); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (T32DE014320); National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate, NDSEG",This research was supported by NSF Grant 11-18792 to RJN.

Yet, the potential ecological impact of the resultant light pollution has only recently emerged as a major cause for concern. While investigations have demonstrated that artificial lighting can influence organism behaviour, reproductive success and survivorship, none have addressed whether it is altering the composition of communities. We show, for the first time, that invertebrate community composition is affected by proximity to street lighting independently of the time of day. Five major invertebrate groups contributed to compositional differences, resulting in an increase in the number of predatory and scavenging individuals in brightly lit communities. Our results indicate that street lighting changes the environment at higher levels of biological organization than previously recognized, raising the potential that it can alter the structure and function of ecosystems. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Artificial light pollution; Community composition; Ground-dwelling invertebrates; High pressure sodium; Street lights,Invertebrata; community composition; economic development; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; high pressure; invertebrate; light effect; reproductive success; scavenging (feeding); sodium; survivorship; urbanization,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (268504)",,"Holker F., Et al., The dark side of light: A transdisciplinary research agenda for light pollution policy, Ecol.

I tested the hypothesis that urban exploiters should be more likely to utilize bright, unpredictable light pollution sources such as sport stadiums and building sites than urban avoiders. I quantified insectivorous bat activity and feeding attempts at seven sport stadiums under light and dark treatments using acoustic monitoring of echolocation calls. Species richness estimators indicated that stadium inventories were complete. Activity and feeding attempts were significantly higher at lit stadiums than dark stadiums, irrespective of season or surrounding human land use. Bats exhibited species-specific differences in utilization of stadiums. As predicted, four urban exploiters - Chaerephon pumilus, Tadarida aegyptiaca, Otomops martiensseni and Scotophilus dinganii - dominated activity and feeding attempts at lit stadiums, yet one urban exploiter - Mops condylurus - was associated with dark stadiums. Activity levels at both dark and light stadiums were negatively correlated with peak echolocation frequency. Landscape-scale and finer scale abiotic variables were poor predictors of bat activity and feeding attempts. My results suggest that in addition to abiotic processes associated with urbanization, light pollution at sport stadiums may homogenize urban bat diversity by favoring selected urban exploiters. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.",Artificial light; Bat activity; Light pollution; Molossidae; Predator-prey interactions; Urban avoiders; Urban exploiters,Chaerephon pumila; Molossidae; Mops condylurus; Otomops martiensseni; Scotophilus dinganii; Tadarida aegyptiaca; bat; feeding behavior; light pollution; predator-prey interaction; species inventory; species richness; sports facility,,,,,,,"Acharya L., Fenton M.B., Bat attacks and moth defensive behavior around streetlights, Can.

However, natural light is now enhanced by artificial light at night, particularly in urban areas. This alteration of natural light environments during the night is hypothesised to alter biological rhythms in fish, by effecting night-time production of the hormone melatonin. Artificial light at night is also expected to increase the stress level of fish, resulting in higher cortisol production. In laboratory experiments, European perch (Perca fluviatilis) were exposed to four different light intensities during the night, 0 lx (control), 1 lx (potential light level in urban waters), 10 lx (typical street lighting at night) and 100 lx. Melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured from water samples every 3 h during a 24 hour period. This study revealed that the nocturnal increase in melatonin production was inhibited even at the lowest light level of 1 lx. However, cortisol levels did not differ between control and treatment illumination levels. We conclude that artificial light at night at very low intensities may disturb biological rhythms in fish since nocturnal light levels around 1 lx are already found in urban waters. However, enhanced stress induction could not be demonstrated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Fish; Light intensity; Light pollution; Non-invasive hormone measurement; Perca fluviatilis,Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Fishes; Hydrocortisone; Light; Melatonin; Perches; Photic Stimulation; Perca fluviatilis; Cortisol; Fish; hydrocortisone; melatonin; Hydrocortisone; Melatonin; Biological rhythm; Circadian rhythms; Different lights; Illumination levels; In-laboratory experiments; Light intensity; Light pollution; Perca fluviatilis; biological rhythm; circadian rhythm; hormone; light intensity; light pollution; perciform; animal experiment; Article; circadian rhythm; comparative study; controlled study; hormone determination; hormone synthesis; illumination; light intensity; light pollution; light stress; night; non invasive measurement; nonhuman; Perca fluviatilis; photoacclimatization; photoperiodicity; water quality; water sampling; animals; Circadian Rhythm; Fishes; Light; metabolism; Perches; Photic Stimulation; physiology; Pollution,,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; melatonin, 73-31-4; Hydrocortisone, ; Melatonin, ",,,"Verlust der Nacht project; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (BMBF-033L038A)","The authors thank T.

The most well-known and widely documented consequence of light pollution is the generally fatal attraction of nocturnal insects to artificial light sources. However, the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Here we report that moth populations from urban areas with high, globally relevant levels of light pollution over several decades show a significantly reduced flight-to-light behaviour compared with populations of the same species from pristine dark-sky habitats. Using a common garden setting, we reared moths from 10 different populations from early-instar larvae and experimentally compared their flight-to-light behaviour under standardized conditions. Moths from urban populations had a significant reduction in the flight-to-light behaviour compared with pristine populations. The reduced attraction to light sources of 'city moths' may directly increase these individuals' survival and reproduction. We anticipate that it comes with a reduced mobility, which negatively affects foraging as well as colonization ability. As nocturnal insects are of eminent significance as pollinators and the primary food source of many vertebrates, an evolutionary change of the flight-to-light behaviour thereby potentially cascades across species interaction networks. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, our understanding of the ecological consequences of light pollution is limited [2-4]. We investigated effects of artificial night lighting on dawn song in five common forest-breeding songbirds. In four species, males near street lights started singing significantly earlier at dawn than males elsewhere in the forest, and this effect was stronger in naturally earlier-singing species. We compared reproductive behavior of blue tits breeding in edge territories with and without street lights to that of blue tits breeding in central territories over a 7 year period. Under the influence of street lights, females started egg laying on average 1.5 days earlier. Males occupying edge territories with street lights were twice as successful in obtaining extra-pair mates than their close neighbors or than males occupying central forest territories. Artificial night lighting affected both age classes but had a stronger effect on yearling males. Our findings indicate that light pollution has substantial effects on the timing of reproductive behavior and on individual mating patterns. It may have important evolutionary consequences by changing the information embedded in previously reliable quality-indicator traits [5, 6]. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Animals; Environmental Pollution; Female; Light; Lighting; Male; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Songbirds; Time Factors; Vocalization, Animal; Passeri; animal; article; female; illumination; light; male; physiology; pollution; reproduction; sexual behavior; songbird; time; vocalization",,,,,"Austrian Academy for Sciences; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","We are indebted to all of the people who helped with field and laboratory work, in particular Kaspar Delhey, Kathi Foerster, Sylvia Kuhn, Anne Peters, Kim Teltscher, and Agnes Tuerk.

Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat-insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume ± SD: 5·91 ± 6·25%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume ± SD: 35·42 ± 17·90%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence. © 2014 The Authors.",Arms race;

Understanding of how these impacts translate into changes in population dynamics of communities with multiple trophic levels is, however, severely lacking. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment we tested the effect of ALAN on the population dynamics of a plant-aphid-parasitoid community with one plant species, three aphid species and their specialist parasitoids. The light treatment reduced the abundance of two aphid species by 20% over five generations, most likely as a consequence of bottom-up effects, with reductions in bean plant biomass being observed. For the aphid Megoura viciae this effect was reversed under autumn conditions with the light treatment promoting continuous reproduction through asexuals. All three parasitoid species were negatively affected by the light treatment, through reduced host numbers and we discuss induced possible behavioural changes. These results suggest that, in addition to direct impacts on species behaviour, the impacts of ALAN can cascade through food webs with potentially far reaching effects on the wider ecosystem. © 2015, Nature Research.

Many amphipod species migrate between the benthos and the pelagic environment and light seems is a main ecological factor which regulates migration. We explore the effect of artificial lighting on amphipod assemblages using two kind of lights, LED and halogen, and control traps in shallow waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Both types of artificial light traps showed a significantly higher abundance of individuals for all species in comparison to control traps. LED lights showed a stronger effect over the amphipod assemblages, with these traps collecting a higher number of individuals and differing species composition, with some species showing a specific attraction to LED light.

Although jet lag and shift work are well-documented challenges to circadian organization, many more subtle environmental changes cause circadian disruption. For example, frequent fluctuations in the timing of the sleep/wake schedule, as well as exposure to nighttime lighting, likely affect the circadian system. Most studies of these effects have focused on nocturnal rodents, which are very different from diurnal species with respect to their patterns of light exposure and the effects that light can have on their activity. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of nighttime light on behavior and the brain of a diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat. Following 3 weeks of exposure to standard light/dark (LD; 14:10 light [∼150 lux] /dark [0 lux]) or dim light at night (dLAN; 14:10 light [∼150 lux] /dim [5 lux]), rats underwent behavioral testing, and hippocampal neurons within CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were examined. Three behavioral effects of dLAN were observed: (1) decreased preference for a sucrose solution, (2) increased latency to float in a forced swim test, and (3) impaired learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Light at night also reduced dendritic length in DG and basilar CA1 dendrites. Dendritic length in the DG positively correlated with sucrose consumption in the sucrose anhedonia task. Nighttime light exposure did not disrupt the pattern of circadian locomotor activity, and all grass rats maintained a diurnal activity pattern. Together, these data suggest that exposure to dLAN can alter affective responses and impair cognition in a diurnal animal. © 2012 The Author(s).",Arvicanthis niloticus; depression; hippocampus; memory,"Analysis of Variance; Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; CA3 Region, Hippocampal; Circadian Rhythm; Cognition; Corticosterone; Dendrites; Dentate Gyrus; Depressive Disorder; Food Preferences; Light; Male; Maze Learning; Motor Activity; Murinae; Neurons; Photoperiod; Swimming; Acroceras macrum; Animalia; Arvicanthis niloticus; Rattus; Rodentia; corticosterone; analysis of variance; animal; article; blood; circadian rhythm; cognition; cytology; dendrite; dentate gyrus; depression; drug effect; food preference; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA3 region; light; male; maze test; motor activity; Murinae; nerve cell; pathophysiology; photoperiodicity; physiology; radiation exposure; swimming",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; Corticosterone, 50-22-6",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (IOS 04-16897); American Heart Association, AHA; United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (2005-337)","The authors thank James Walton, Zachary Weil, and Tracy Bedrosian for technical assistance and Sallion Wolfe for excellent animal care.

Although ultraviolet and blue light are usually most attractive to arthropods, degree of attraction varies among orders. With a focus on future indoor lighting applications, we manipulated the spectrum of white lamps to investigate the influence of spectral composition on number of arthropods attracted.We compared numbers of arthropods captured at three customizable light-emitting diode (LED) lamps (3510, 2704 and 2728 K), two commercial LED lamps (2700 K), two commercial compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs; 2700 K) and a control. We configured the three custom LEDs to minimize invertebrate attraction based on published attraction curves for honeybees and moths. Lamps were placed with pan traps at an urban and two rural study sites in Los Angeles, California. For all invertebrate orders combined, our custom LED configurations were less attractive than the commercial LED lamps or CFLs of similar colour temperatures. Thus, adjusting spectral composition of white light to minimize attracting nocturnal arthropods is feasible; not all lightswith the same colour temperature are equally attractive to arthropods. © 2015 The Authors.

The pineal melatonin rhythm and its regulation by light in a subterranean rodent, the valley pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae). J. Pineal Res. 1994; 16: 145–153. The daytime and nighttime levels of pineal N‐acetyltransferase (NAT) activity, hydroxyindole‐O‐methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity, and melatonin were measured in adult male and female valley pocket gophers, Thomomys bottae. This species was chosen for study because it is a subterranean rodent that inhabits burrows whose openings to the surface are closed. Therefore, under field conditions it is estimated that the pocket gopher spends roughly 99% of its time in absolute darkness in underground burrows. When wild captured pocket gophers were maintained under a light dark cycle (light intensity during the day of roughly 140 μ,W/cm2), nighttime levels of pineal NAT activity and melatonin content were higher than values measured during the day; on the other hand, HIOMT activity in the pineal gland was similar in the day and at night. When pocket gophers were exposed to an extended light period (220 μW/cm2) 4 hr into the night, the rise in melatonin synthesis normally associated with darkness onset was not inhibited. Also, when gophers were acutely exposed to a light intensity of 400 μW/cm2 for 1 hr beginning 4 hr after darkness onset, neither high nocturnal levels of pineal NAT nor pineal melatonin contents were reduced. Finally, when pocket gophers were exposed to a 600 (μW/cm2 light intensity at either 4 hr or 8 hr into the dark period, pineal melatonin synthesis remained elevated at a level comparable to that measured in dark‐exposed controls. The results show that under controlled laboratory conditions the pineal gland of the valley pocket gopher, a species that in its natural habitat spends about 99% of its time in absolute darkness, exhibits higher melatonin synthesis during night than during the day. While the rhythm in pineal melatonin production in the pocket gopher is clearly synchronized by the prevailing light: dark cycle, high nighttime pineal melatonin synthesis is not readily inhibited by light in the intensity range of 220 to 600μW/cm2. In terms of its relative insensitivity to light at night, the pineal gland of the valley pocket gopher resembles that of other diurnally active rodents. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Invasive, non-native species are one of the largest threats to freshwater biodiversity; however, the impact of ALAN on such species is unknown. This study assessed the effects of ALAN at ecologically relevant levels on the behaviour of a globally widespread invasive species, the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus). In experimental aquaria, crayfish were exposed to periods of daylight, control (<0.1 lx) and street-lit nights to test two hypotheses: (1) signal crayfish under natural conditions are nocturnal animals, spending more time in shelter during the day, whilst active and interacting during the night, and (2) ALAN reduces crayfish activity and intraspecific interactions, whilst increasing their propensity to use shelter. Our results confirm that signal crayfish are largely nocturnal, showing peak activity and interaction levels during control nights, whilst taking refuge during daylight hours. When exposed to short-term simulated light pollution from a streetlight at night however, activity and interactions with conspecifics were significantly reduced compared to control nights, whilst time spent in shelters increased. By altering crayfish behaviour, ALAN may change the ecosystem impacts of invasive crayfish in the wild. This study is the first to show an impact of ALAN on the behaviour of an invasive, non-native species, and provides information for the management of invasive crayfish in areas where ALAN is prevalent. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Crayfish behaviour; Ecological light pollution; INNS; Pacifastacus leniusculus; Streetlight; Wildlife management,Animalia; Astacoidea; Pacifastacus leniusculus; biodiversity; conspecific; crayfish; environmental effect; freshwater environment; intraspecific interaction; invasive species; light pollution; signaling; wildlife management,,,,,"Cefas and Eco-explore; EU's Convergence European Social Fund; Welsh Assembly Government; European Social Fund, ESF","JRT was funded by The Knowledge and Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS), Cefas and Eco-explore.

Estuarine and coastal wetlands are particularly exposed to such illumination because shorelines often are heavily utilized by man. However, the impact of artificial illumination on the waders that forage in these highly productive habitats is virtually unknown. We evaluated the effects of artificial illumination on the nocturnal habitat selection and foraging behaviour of six wader species with different feeding strategies: three visual foragers, two species that alternate visual and tactile strategies (mixed foragers), and one tactile forager. We quantified the number of birds and their foraging behaviour at sites affected and not affected by streetlights, and also before and after illuminating experimental sites. Areas illuminated by streetlights were used more during the night by visual foragers, and to a lesser extent by mixed foragers, than non-illuminated areas. Visual foragers increased their foraging effort in illuminated areas, and mixed foragers changed to more efficient visual foraging strategies. These behavioural shifts improved prey intake rate by an average of 83% in visual and mixed foragers. We have showed that artificial illumination has a positive effect on the nocturnal foraging of waders, but on the other hand may draw them to degraded areas close to urban centres, and potentially raises their exposure to predators. Our findings suggest that artificial illumination is worth investigation as a tool in the management of intertidal habitats for waders. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Understanding the implications of this disturbance for species and populations is crucial for conservation biologists wishing to mitigate negative effects. Anthropogenic light pollution is an increasing global problem [2], affecting ecological interactions across a range of taxa and impacting negatively upon critical animal behaviors including foraging, reproduction, and communication (for review see [2, 3]). Almost all bats are nocturnal [4], making them ideal subjects for testing the effects of light pollution. Previous studies have shown that bat species adapted to foraging in open environments feed on insects attracted to mercury vapor lamps. Here, we use an experimental approach to provide the first evidence of a negative effect of artificial light pollution on the commuting behavior of a threatened bat species. We installed high-pressure sodium lights that mimic the intensity and light spectra of streetlights along commuting routes of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Bat activity was reduced dramatically and the onset of commuting behavior was delayed in the presence of lighting, with no evidence of habituation. These results demonstrate that light pollution may have significant negative impacts upon the selection of flight routes by bats. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there have been no studies that have tested whether 'turtle-friendly' lights are benign to hatchling sea turtle sea-finding ability. Aims We tested two different types of 'turtle-friendly' lights (LED amber-light peak intensity 620nm and LED red-light peak intensity 640nm) to see whether they are disruptive to the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings. Methods Using standard circular-arena experiments, we assessed the directional preference of newly emerged loggerhead turtle hatchlings from the Woongarra Coast of Queensland, Australia, during different moon phases without artificial lighting and in the presence of 'turtle-friendly' lights. Key results Contrary to expectations, sea-finding ability of hatchlings was disrupted by the amber lights, particularly in the absence of a moon. The less intense red lights were less disruptive to hatchlings; however, misorientation and disorientation events still occurred when lights were within 4m of hatchlings. The disruptive impact on sea-finding ability increased with the cumulative impact of multiple lights increasing light intensity. Conclusions The 'turtle-friendly' lights we used disrupted the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings, with the most pronounced disruption occurring under moonless conditions. Implications The use of amber and red LED lights adjacent to the nesting beaches of loggerhead sea turtles should be managed because this lighting has the potential to disrupt the sea-finding ability of sea turtle hatchlings. © The authors 2016.",disorientation; light pollution; misorientation; sea-turtle hatchling,Australia; Queensland; Caretta; Caretta caretta; Cheloniidae; Testudines; age structure; behavioral response; experimental study; light intensity; light pollution; nature conservation; nesting behavior; species conservation; turtle,,,,,,,"Adamany S.L., Salmon M., Witherington B.E., Behavior of sea turtles at an urban beach.
